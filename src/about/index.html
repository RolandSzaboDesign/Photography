			<p>Hey, I'm Roland, nice to meet you! I'm a 32-year-old aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary. I used to shoot on my phone a lot, and I picked up a digital camera about a year ago.</p>
			<p>I primarily shoot solo and couple portraits, vehicles, landscapes and streets, but I don't shy away from the occasional product and event photography every now and then.</p>
			<p>I shoot on my trusty Sony Alpha 6400 with a bunch of amazing lenses: the Sigma 56mm f/1.4, Sigma 30mm f/1.4, and the Sony 85mm f/1.8 as my primes, and the Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8 for run-and-gun situations.</p>
			<p>When not out shooting or editing, <a href="https://rolandszabo.design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I design webthings</a> for a living, and I play video- and board games for fun. My other hobbies are cardistry and getting quicker at solving the 3×3 Rubik's cube.</p>
			<p>Don't be afraid to <a href="/contact">say hello</a>!</p>
