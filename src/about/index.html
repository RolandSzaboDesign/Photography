			<p>Hey, I'm Roland, nice to meet you! I'm a 31-year-old aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary. I've been shooting on my phone a lot, and I picked up a digital camera just recently.</p>
			<p>I primarily shoot solo and couple portraits, vehicles, landscapes and streets, but I don't shy away from the occasional product and event photography every now and then.</p>
			<p>I regularly go out for photowalks around the city to hone my skills as a photographer. I spend a lot of time in post-production, practicing photo editing to come up with my own creative style.</p>
			<p>When not out shooting or editing all those photos I take, <a href="https://rolandszabo.design" target="_blank">I design webthings</a> for a living, and I play video- and board games for fun.</p>
			<p>This website contains some of my most favourite photos I took over the past few months trying to get to know to my camera. Please enjoy it, and don't be afraid to <a href="/contact">say hello</a>!</p>
