			<p>Hey, I'm Roland, nice to meet you! I'm a 31-year-old aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary. I've been shooting on my phone a lot, and I picked up a digital camera just recently.</p>
			<p>I primarily shoot solo and couple portraits, vehicles, landscapes and streets, but I don't shy away from the occasional product and event photography every now and then.</p>
			<p>I shoot on my trusty Sony Alpha a6000 with three of my favorite lenses: the Sigma 56mm f/1.4 and the Sony 85mm f/1.8 for automotive and portraits, and the Tamron 17-70 f/2.8 to run and gun. I also own a Samyang 16mm f/2.0 to do ultra-wide stuff.</p>
			<p>When not out shooting or editing, <a href="https://rolandszabo.design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I design webthings</a> for a living, and I play video- and board games for fun.</p>
			<p>Don't be afraid to <a href="/contact">say hello</a>!</p>
