<p>Hey, I'm Roland, nice to meet you! I'm a <span title="ðŸ‘´">32-year-old</span> aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary. I used to shoot on my phone a lot, and I picked up a digital camera about a good year-and-a-half ago.</p>
<p>I got very close to technology at a rather young age, and I've always been fascinated by the ways I was able to create. I've tried multiple avenues of creativity, including music and design, but photography has definitely become the one I got to feel the most fulfilled in. The ability to capture moments and share them with others is what drives me to wake up every day.</p>
<p>I've been shooting APS-C since the day I started photography, first with the Sony Alpha 6000 for a good year, then I upgraded to the a6400. I have an army of <a href="/{{ locale }}/{{ site[locale].slugGear }}/">lenses and accessories</a> for almost all situations.</p>
<p>When not out shooting or editing, <a href="https://rolandszabo.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I design webthings</a> for a living, and I play video- and board games for fun. My other hobbies are cardistry and getting quicker at solving the 3Ã—3 Rubik's cube.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear from you, don't be afraid to <a href="/{{ locale }}/{{ site[locale].slugContact }}/">say hello</a>!</p>
