<p>Hey there, I'm Roland! At <span title="ðŸ‘´">34</span>, I'm not just an aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary&mdash;I'm someone who's passionate about capturing the genuine beauty in every moment.</p>
<p>I thrive on candid moments and the realness they convey. My aim is to bring out your authenticity and make you fall in love with portrait photography, just like I have.</p>
<p>For me, the camera is more than just a tool; it's an extension of my creative self, a means of communicating with people, and a constant companion on my journey. Photography has opened doors to connections that were previously unimaginable, and for that, I am eternally grateful.</p>
<p>When I'm not behind the lens or immersed in the world of editing, <a href="https://rolandszabo.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm designing websites</a> for a living, indulging in video and board games, practicing cardistry, or trying to solve the 3Ã—3 Rubik's cube faster than ever before.</p>
<p>I'd absolutely love to hear from you, so <a href="/{{ locale }}/{{ site[locale].slugContact }}/">don't hesitate to say hello</a>!</p>
