		<h2 class="calendar__subtitle">Prices</h2>
		<p>For the first time, you can choose your price for the calendar. I'm offering a base package and a supporter package.</p>
		<ul class="calendar__packages">
			<li class="calendar__package">
				<h3>Base Package</h3>
				<h4><strong>7.000 HUF</strong></h4>
				<p>Contains the calendar in its full glory.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="calendar__package">
				<h3>Supporter Package</h3>
				<h4><strong>20.000 HUF</strong></h4>
				<p>Contains the calendar and a limited edition voucher, which will grant you a 50% discount on your first solo or couple portrait shoot with me in 2023. However many photos you choose in the end, they'll be half the regular price. This is a great investment if you're planning a shoot next year &mdash; or if you just want to support my work! Valid until 1 December 2023.</p>

		<div class="calendar__grid-3">
			<ul class="list">
				<li>I'm happy to meet up with you in the inner city of Budapest, where I can hand the calendar over with a personal thank you for your support.</li>
				<li>If you live in the countryside or abroad, it's possible to have it posted, but please note, that I take no responsibility for the package to arrive in one piece and on time. For postage in Hungary, I prefer FoxPost.</li>
				<li>You should be able to pick your copy up after the 17th of December 2022. That's one week before Christmas. Same date goes for having it posted.</li>
