    title: "Discover Your True Self in Photos"
    text1: "Hi! I'm Roland, a portrait photographer from Budapest and I'm glad you're here."
    text2: "If you've ever felt that you're not photogenic or that you can't show your true self in front of the camera, I know exactly what you're going through. Many people feel that way - and it's totally understandable. That's why <strong>I don't just offer a photo shoot, but an experience that helps you see yourself through different eyes</strong>."
    text3: "I have been photographing people for almost four years, but my story started much earlier. I've always been fascinated by the individual beauty of humans - the tiny gestures, the natural radiance, the moments when someone is truly themselves. I realised that a good photograph is not just about the camera, but about how you feel in front of it. And that's where I help."
    whyTitle: "Why am I doing this?"
    whyText: "Because I believe that everyone is photogenic - you just need the right environment and guidance. My goal is to help you experience that feeling when you finally see the person you feel inside back in a photo."
    howTitle: "How do I work?"
    howText: "With empathy, attention and a touch of humour. Photography doesn't have to be stressful - with me you don't need to know posing tricks or be stressed. I'll help you, guide you through and make sure you have a good time while doing it. The initial excitement will quickly dissipate, giving way to a natural, easy atmosphere where you can look your best."
    whatTitle: "What do you receive?"
    whatText: "Not just photos, but a great experience and a new perspective of yourself. The images I take will not only be aesthetically beautiful, but will also give you a newfound confidence. You'll get portraits that you'll be proud to look at and that will remind you that you are indeed photogenic - and ones you'll really love."
    cta: "If you're ready to discover yourself from a new perspective, let's get started!"
