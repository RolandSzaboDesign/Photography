about:
    title: Hi, I'm Roland.
    intro: I believe that anyone – and anything – can look great in a photo with the right approach.
    text1: "Many people believe things like “I just don’t look good in photos” or “my car isn’t special enough for a professional shoot.” But I believe every person and every vehicle has that unique character that, when captured well, creates stunning images. That’s where I come in."
    text2: "Photography with me isn’t about squeezing you into a predefined template. Quite the opposite – I shape the process around you, so you feel natural, confident, and true to yourself in front of the camera. You don’t need to know how to pose, and you definitely don’t need to feel awkward."
    text3: "With over 500 photoshoots behind me, I’ve learned how to find the beauty in everything – whether it’s you or your car in front of my lens."
