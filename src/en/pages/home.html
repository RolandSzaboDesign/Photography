<h2 class="home__title mt-0">I believe I can take great portraits of anyone.</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Roland, I've been taking photos with professional equipment for 3 years, and I'm dedicated to making people fall in love with portrait photography.</p>
<p>Many of my customers have told me that they are reluctant to do portrait photography because they don't think they are photogenic or they don't know what to do in front of the camera.</p>
<p>There is no more rewarding feeling than when these same customers see the first picture I take of them in the camera, and I see how the accumulated burden disappears in an instant, and they smile in huge surprise. After that, I don't even need to tell you how laid-back and relaxed the photoshoot continues after these moments.</p>
<p>During my photography walks, I guarantee that you will have a great time with my empathetic personality and diverse humor!</p>
<p>If you don't like taking photos either, because you're afraid of the same thing, then you're in the right place! I'm ready. And you?</p>
