about:
    title: Hi, I'm Roland.
    intro: I don't just take pictures. <strong>I work with people</strong>.
    text: After five years and more than 500 photo sessions, I’ve realized that photography is not about technique, but about human connection. These days, I’m not chasing perfect images, but the experience I can create through the process. When there’s trust and a shared rhythm between us, good photos simply happen. With this in mind, I offer an experience that stays with you long after the photos are taken.

        text: "Over the years I’ve learned how to align light, moment and personality in a way that feels natural yet captivating. My goal is for each image to tell a story. About you, and about the way you see the world. The technique itself is only a tool to create something real and honest."
    professional:
        title: Marketing Strategist
        text: "A good photo doesn’t just look nice; it sells. I understand what makes an image effective both online and offline, how it draws attention and helps sell a service, a product or even you. My strategic mindset is always there in the background: in the composition, the color balance and the authenticity of the moment. You only get one chance to make a first impression, after all."

        text: "I’ve been on the other side too. I know what it feels like when you can’t quite find your focus&hellip; either on yourself or in the world. There are days when confidence doesn’t come easily to me either, and that’s when I remind myself that imperfection is far more genuine than perfection. That’s why I don’t try to make anyone 'better'; I just reveal what’s already there."
