description: Natural, documentary-style event photography in Budapest. I capture genuine moments that let you relive the atmosphere and emotions of your special day.

<p>The essence of every event lies in its genuine moments. A smile, a handshake, a shared laugh that might go unnoticed, yet becomes an everlasting memory.</p>
<p>For me, event photography isn’t about poses or decorations, but about capturing the moments that truly show what it felt like to be there. The light, the movement, the glances&hellip; together they tell the story of the day.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a corporate event, a conference, a wedding, or a family gathering, my goal is for the photos to do more than preserve the memories. It's to let you relive them, even years later.</p>
