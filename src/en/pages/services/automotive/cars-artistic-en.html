    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    items:
      - question: "How long does an artistic car photoshoot take?"
        answer: "Typically 1-2 hours, depending on how many locations we shoot at and how much detail you want to focus on. If you’d like multiple backgrounds, it may take longer."
      - question: "Where does the photoshoot take place?"
        answer: "We select the location together. It could be in an urban environment, with a natural backdrop, at an industrial site, or on an iconic road. If you’re unsure, I can help find the perfect spot!"
      - question: "How should I prepare my car for the shoot?"
        answer: "It’s essential that your car is clean and well-maintained for the shoot! A full wash, wax, and interior cleaning are recommended to ensure every detail looks perfect in the final images."
      - question: "When is the best time for a shoot?"
        answer: "The most stunning images are taken at sunrise, sunset, or in soft, diffused light. Harsh midday sunlight isn’t always ideal, so we’ll choose the best time based on the weather and location."

        answer: "If the weather isn’t ideal (heavy rain, muddy conditions, or overly cloudy skies), we’ll reschedule to ensure your car looks its absolute best."
      - question: "What kind of images will I receive?"
        answer: "The final images are delivered in high resolution and professionally edited, ensuring your car looks its best. You’ll be able to choose your favorites from the gallery and receive them digitally."
