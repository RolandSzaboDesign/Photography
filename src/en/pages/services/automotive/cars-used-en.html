why:
    title: Why invest in professional used car photography?
    items:
      - title: "More interest, faster sale:"
        text: "A great listing captures the buyer’s attention at first glance. If your car is presented in a high-quality way, more people will inquire, and it will sell faster."
      - title: "Your ad stands out instantly:"
        text: "Most sellers use phone photos, which are often blurry, tilted, or taken from unflattering angles. A professional photo immediately grabs attention in a crowded listing, leading to more clicks. If your first image is striking, buyers are much more likely to view your ad."
      - title: "Higher price, less negotiation:"
        text: "Professional photos increase the perceived value of your car. A well-presented vehicle can attract buyers willing to pay more and reduces the likelihood of price haggling."
      - title: "Fewer unnecessary questions, more serious buyers:"
        text: "When all the important details of the car are clearly visible in the photos, you’ll spend less time answering repetitive messages and calls. Only serious buyers will contact you."
      - title: "High-quality photos suggest a well-maintained car:"
        text: "If a seller invests in high-quality listing photos, buyers assume the car has been equally well cared for. A clean, well-presented car signals to potential buyers that it has been properly maintained and is worth considering."
