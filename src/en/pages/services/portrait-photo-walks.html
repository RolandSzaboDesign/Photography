					<p>Time for the magic to happen! During our photoshoot, I'm not just your photographer; I'm your guide to making every moment shine.</p>
					<p><strong>Posing Made Easy:</strong> If you're unsure about poses, don't worry—I've got your back. I'll provide friendly and easy-to-follow guidance to help you overcome camera shyness. As we navigate through poses together, any initial uncertainties will give way to your most natural and stunning self.</p>
					<p><strong>Fun and Relaxed Vibes:</strong> Expect a session filled with laughter and genuine moments.

So brace yourself for a bunch of bad jokes and prompts, that bring out your most authentic smiles.</p>
					<p><strong>Connecting Through Stories:</strong> Beyond the camera, I'm all ears for your story. Conversations help us relax, setting the stage for photos without inhibition or hindrances. As we get to know each other, we'll capture wonderful moments that will reflect your true self.</p>
					<p><strong>Your Transformation:</strong> Remember the days of feeling camera shy? Get ready to leave those behind. As we click away, you'll witness the transformation from hesitancy to embracing the camera, and in the end, falling in love with your portraits that we create together.</p>

					<p>I'm a huge advocate of giving clients something on the day of the shoot. For the sake of this, <strong>you'll receive one of my favorite photos of the shoot for free</strong>, edited and retouched, at the end of the day.</p>
					<p>After this, I'll go through the photos we took and do the initial culling. This means I'll delete all the photos that are blurry, duplicate, or unbecoming. You don't need to see them, and I don't need to keep them.</p>
					<p>Once this is done, I'll send all the remaining photos for you to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch. These photos will be in black-and-white, small size and watermarked.</p>
					<p>Once you come back to me with your selection, please allow me 1-3 days to finish editing and retouching your photos.</p>
					<p>If you need help printing your photos or creating a photo album, I can assist you with that as well.</p>

You can select further photos for a price of 1.000 HUF each. Should you need many more photos, we'll figure out a personalized discount for you.</p>

This is applicable to the outer districts of Budapest and the countryside. The maximum distance of the carsharing vehicles is ~100km in one direction, and their maximum daily fee is 14.000 HUF).</li>

				<li>If you'd like to shoot at a place that requires an entry fee or a permit, these expenses should be paid by you.</li>
