					<p class="page-header__intro">I want to show everyone's unique beauty by proving they're naturally photogenic, overcoming camera discomfort.</p>
					<p>Through easygoing photo sessions in Budapest, I use empathy and humor. I also teach simple posing to boost confidence and help people feel at ease in front of the camera.</p>
					<p>It's more than just photosâ€”it's about feeling good. I capture authentic beauty, offer posing tips, and leave clients with not just pictures but newfound confidence in their natural charm.</p>

					<p>Before we get into things, you should have a basic idea for your photoshoot; a theme or a concept, if you have any. Be sure to send me a few inspirational photos you found online. Here are a few examples to get you started:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Urban photoshoot with modern architectural backgrounds, wearing a smart outfit</li>
						<li>Close-to-nature photoshoot, wearing a long, colorful dress, located in one of the nearby nature reserves or forests in the afternoon</li>
						<li>Night photoshoot downtown with lots of colorful bokeh balls in the background, wearing a shiny, reflective top to play with the city lights</li>
						<li><em>Your creative idea goes here</em> ðŸ˜‰</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Based on your preferences, we can create a moodboard together, which we can refer to during your photoshoot.</p>
					<p>Please also have a ballpark number of photos you'd need, as we'll set the length of your photoshoot based on this.</p>
				</li>

					<p>During the photoshoot, I'll gladly assist you with prompts and posing, and tell a bunch of bad jokes to bring out your best smiles. I'll do my utmost to make you comfortable during the shoot, so you don't need to worry about a thing.</p>
					<p>I'll also want to listen to your story, if you're willing to tell me; and I can also tell you my story, if you're interested. Talking and listening helps you to relax, and proceed with taking photos without inhibition or hindrances. We can create some incredibly intimate photos when we start getting to know each other better.</p>
					<p>We don't need to strictly adhere to our moodboard, so if you find an interesting location that strikes your imagination, say it loud, and we can take a detour. The best photos are the spontaneous ones!</p>

					<p>I'm a huge advocate of giving clients something on the day of the shoot. For the sake of this, <strong>you'll receive one of my favorite photos of the shoot for free</strong>, edited and retouched, at the end of the day.</p>
					<p>After this, I'll go through the photos we took and do the initial culling. This means I'll delete all the photos that are blurry, duplicate, or unbecoming. You don't need to see them, and I don't need to keep them.</p>
					<p>Once this is done, I'll send all the remaining photos for you to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch. These photos will be in black-and-white, small size and watermarked.</p>
					<p>Once you come back to me with your selection, please allow me 1-3 days to finish editing and retouching your photos.</p>
					<p>If you need help printing your photos or creating a photo album, I can assist you with that as well.</p>

			</figure>
			<p><strong>Changes in pricing from 15 August 2023:</strong></p>
			<p>The session fee of my portrait photography is 25.000 HUF, which contains 10Ã— edited, retouched photos, which you yourself can choose after the photoshoot. You can select further photos for a price of 1.000 HUF each. Should you need many more photos, we'll figure out a personalized discount for you.</p>
			<p>The photoshoot usually takes around 1-2 hours, but it can last for a maximum of 3 hours. Full-day (more than 3 hours) photoshoots are possible and welcome, for these, we'll figure out a personalized pricing structure based on your needs.</p>
			<p>In certain cases, additional charges may occur:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>If the place of your photoshoot requires me to use more than 1 mode of public transport, I'll use a carsharing service to drive there on my own, and this fee should be paid by you. This is applicable to the outer districts of Budapest and the countryside. The maximum distance of the carsharing vehicles is ~100km in one direction, and their maximum daily fee is 14.000 HUF).</li>
				<li>If your portrait shoot involves more than 1 location, I can help transport us between destinations safely, quickly and efficiently with carsharing. The carsharing fee should be paid by you, this is normally around a few thousand HUF in Budapest.</li>
				<li>If you'd like to shoot at a place that requires an entry fee or a permit, these expenses should be paid by you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Payment should be made after selecting your final photos for editing, and I've confirmed the number of photos. I accept bank transfer, Revolut, or PayPal. I do not accept cash. You will receive your final edited photos in 1-5 days after payment has been made.</p>
			<p>You don't need to pay a retainer for your photoshoot.</p>
