			<p>Over the years, I've developed a method that I truly believe will make you feel right at home with me as your photographer. Here are just a few of the ways I think you'll love working with me.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Personalized Experience:</strong> I don't see portrait photography as a production line job. I see it as a unique, personalized experience, and I love making people feel comfortable and at ease. My main goal is to make you feel as comfortable as possible, so you can just relax and enjoy the photos being taken!</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Empathetic Approach:</strong> I really care about you and your situation, and I'd love for you to talk about your feelings. If you're able to relax and feel at ease, we can create a safe atmosphere where we can both be our true selves and take some truly amazing photos together!</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Flexibility:</strong> You have so many choices! You can choose the location, the outfits, the theme&mdash;everything! I love hearing your ideas during our photo session!</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Same-Day Photo Gift:</strong> On the day of your session, I'll give you one of my favorite photos, edited and retouched, absolutely free of charge! You'll already have a great photo from the day of your session to share or print!</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Freedom to Choose:</strong> After your session, you'll be able to choose your favorite photos for me to work on. I'll be happy to help you find the best ones photographically, but you have 100% freedom to choose the photos you like best. I'm here to make sure you'll love the photos you receive!</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Analog Touch:</strong> I love taking photos with my analog camera! Sometimes I'll take one or two photos on film and I'll gift them to you as soon as I get them back from the lab.</li>
