			<p><strong>Payment:</strong> Due after selecting your final photos for editing and confirmation of the quantity. Payment options include bank transfer, Revolut, or PayPal. No cash accepted.</p>
			<p><strong>Retainer:</strong> Typically, there's no retainer for regular photoshoots. However, based on the specific shoot and its circumstances, I reserve the right to request a retainer. This would cover carsharing fees or any additional expenditures associated with the unique aspects of the shoot. Rest assured, any such requests will be discussed and agreed upon transparently before the shoot.</p>
			<p><strong>Delivery:</strong> You'll receive your edited and retouched photos, in digital format, in 1-7 days (depending on your chosen experience) after payment has been made. I don't deliver raw or unedited photos.</p>

			<p>Over the years I've developed a method that I swear you'll be in good hands with if you choose me as your photographer. Here are some of the benefits I think you'll like.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; Portrait photography for me is not a production line job, but a unique, personalized experience. My primary goal is not to take great photos, but to make you feel as comfortable as possible.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; I really do care about your situation, and you're encouraged to talk about your feelings. If you're able to relax and feel at ease, a safe atmosphere is created that allows us both to be authentic and take great photos.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; You can choose the location, the outfits, the theme, everything. I'm always open to your ideas during our photo session.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; On the day of your session, I will give you one of my favorite photos, edited and retouched, free of charge. So you'll already have a great photo from the day of your session to share or print.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; After your session, you'll be able to choose your favourite photos for me to work on. I'll be happy to help you find the best ones photographically, but you have 100% freedom to choose the photos you like best.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; Sometimes I'll take 1 or 2 photos on film, if I have my analog camera with me. I'll gift you those photos as soon as I get them back from the lab.</li>
			</ul>
