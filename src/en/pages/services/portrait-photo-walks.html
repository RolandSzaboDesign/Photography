		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Preparation</h3>
		<p>Before we get into things, you should have a basic idea for your photoshoot; a theme or a concept, if you hany any. Be sure to send me a few inspirational photos you found online. Here are a few examples to get you started:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Urban photoshoot with modern architectural backgrounds, wearing a smart outfit</li>
			<li>Close-to-nature photoshoot, wearing a long, colorful dress, located in one of the nearby nature reserves or forests in the afternoon</li>
			<li>Night photoshoot downtown with lots of colorful bokeh balls in the background, wearing a shiny, reflective top to play with the city lights</li>
			<li><em>Your creative idea goes here</em> ðŸ˜‰</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Based on your preferences, we can create a moodboard or a specific shot list together, which we can refer to during your photoshoot.</p>
		<p>Please also have a ballpark number of photos you'd need, as we'll set the length of your photoshoot based on this.</p>
	</li>

		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Photoshoot</h3>
		<p>During the photoshoot, I'll gladly assist you with prompts and posing, and tell a bunch of bad jokes to bring out your best smiles.</p>
		<p>I'll also want to listen to your story, if you're willing to tell me. I can also tell you my story, if you're interested. Talking and listening helps you to relax, and we can proceed with taking photos without inhibition or hindrances. We can create some incredibly intimate photos when we start getting to know each other better.</p>
		<p>We don't need to strictly adhere to our moodboard, so if you find an interesting location that strikes your imagination, say it loud, and we can take a detour. The best photos are the spontaneous ones!</p>
	</li>
	<li class="how-it-works__item">
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Delivery</h3>
		<p>I'm a huge advocate of giving clients something on the day of the shoot. For the sake of this, <strong>you'll receive one of my favorite photos of the shoot for free</strong>, edited and retouched, at the end of the day.</p>
		<p>After this, I'll go through the photos we took and do the initial culling. This means I'll delete all the photos that are blurry, duplicate, or unbecoming. You don't need to see them, and I don't need to keep them.</p>
		<p>Once this is done, I'll send all the remaining photos for you to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch. These photos will be in black-and-white, small size and watermarked.</p>
		<p>Once you come back to me with your selection, please allow me 1-3 days to finish editing and retouching your photos.</p>
		<p>If you need help printing your photos or creating a photo album, I can assist you with that as well.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>I'm not a fan of packages, because they don't fit everyone's needs. Here's what I do, instead.</p>
<p><strong>The photoshoot is free.</strong> You only need to pay for the photos you choose in the Delivery phase. Each photo with color-grading and retouching costs 1.500 HUF. After 10Ã— photos onwards, the price goes down to 1.000 HUF each. Should you require a lot more photos, let me know, and we'll figure out a personalized pricing for you.</p>
<p>If we shoot at multiple locations, I can drive us between places via e-carsharing. We'll split the costs of this 50-50. There's no need to deposit an upfront fee either for this, or the entire shoot.</p>
<p>Payment should be made after you're done selecting the photos from the raw ones. I accept bank transfer, Revolut, PayPal or cash.</p>
