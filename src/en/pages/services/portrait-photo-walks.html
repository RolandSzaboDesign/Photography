					<p>Time for the magic to happen! During our photoshoot, I'm not just your photographer; I'm your guide to making every moment shine.</p>
					<p><strong>Posing Made Easy:</strong> If you're unsure about poses, don't worry‚ÄîI've got your back. I'll provide friendly and easy-to-follow guidance to help you overcome camera shyness. As we navigate through poses together, any initial uncertainties will give way to your most natural and stunning self.</p>

					<p>Let's talk about what happens after the shutter clicks! On the day of the shoot, you'll receive a special treat: one of my favorite photos, edited and retouched, completely free.</p>
					<p>Next, I'll dive into the initial culling phase, removing any blurry, duplicate, or less-than-flattering shots. No need for you to see them, and no need for me to keep them.</p>
					<p>Once the selection is refined, I'll send you the remaining photos. These will be in small size and watermarked. It's your chance to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch.</p>
					<p>Once you've made your selection, sit back for 1-3 days, and I'll work my magic on your chosen photos. And hey, if you need assistance with printing or creating a photo album, I've got you covered!</p>
