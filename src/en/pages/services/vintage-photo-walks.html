		<h2>Why Vintage Lenses?</h2>

		<p>Modern (i.e. super-expensive) camera lenses are designed to be so perfect that the imperfections that make a photo realistic are almost completely missing. Having close to perfect image quality does result in extreme ease of use, and the end results are consistently flawless. However, the image quality is so sterile and flat that I'm spending hours in post-production to get my images to look 3D again.</p>
		<p>This is where old vintage optics come in to play. They're full of optical flaws which makes photos taken with them alive and animate. Vintage lenses are more difficult to operate: You need to focus every image one-by-one, they are prone to flaring in direct sunlight, they sometimes leave odd spots in the image, and the list goes on. However, the final photos are something that we can be a lot more proud of, because we're really worked for them. Shooting portraits with vintage lenses is about embracing these optical shortcomings and really enabling our creative juices to flow.</p>
		<h2>How is a portrait photography session different with vintage lenses?</h2>
		<p>Here's a few things to keep in mind, if you're willing to model for a shoot.</p>

		<ul class="list">
			<li><strong>Every image has to be manually focussed.</strong> My camera has several built-in helping features to assist me in finding the perfect focus, but it still takes time to make sure that the images are as sharp as possible. Because of this, you'll need to hold your mimics and poses for a little longer.</li>
			<li><strong>Images are generally more static.</strong> Because of the manual focusing, we can't accurately capture moving scenes, so manual lenses aren't the go-to option to capture movement in photos.</li>
			<li><strong>We'll need to consider flaring.</strong> Old lenses are highly prone to flaring, when shooting in direct sunlight. While we can use flares creatively, it can make photos unusable very quickly. Because of this, we might need to spend more time finding the best angles according to the sunlight.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All in all, we could say that shooting with vintage lenses requires some more patience and some respect for older technologies, in order to create unique, soulful photos.</p>
