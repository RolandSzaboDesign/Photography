			<h2>The Power of a Great Male Portrait</h2>
			<p>A great portrait can open doors and make lasting impressions. Here are just a few ways male portraits can work for you:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>Dating Profiles (Tinder, Bumble, and More):</strong> First impressions matter. A professional yet natural portrait can help your profile stand out for all the right reasons.</li>
				<li><strong>Professional Headshots:</strong> Whether for LinkedIn, your company’s website, or a CV, a strong, confident headshot showcases your professionalism and approachability.</li>
				<li><strong>Creative Portfolios:</strong> If you’re an actor, musician, or creative, a bold and unique portrait can capture your personal brand and help you stand out in your industry.</li>
				<li><strong>Personal Branding:</strong> Entrepreneurs, freelancers, and influencers need portraits that reflect their personality and professionalism. A well-crafted portrait builds trust and credibility with your audience.</li>
				<li><strong>Milestones and Achievements:</strong> Celebrate a personal accomplishment, a fitness journey, or simply document a moment in your life where you feel your best.</li>
				<li><strong>Just Because:</strong> You don’t need a reason to invest in yourself. A portrait session can be an empowering experience that helps you see yourself in a whole new light.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="emphasized"><strong>Have a specific use in mind?</strong> Let’s talk and create your unique portraits that meet your exact goals.</p>
			<p>Whatever your goal, a great portrait isn’t just about how you look—it’s about how you feel and what you’re communicating to the world. Let’s create the perfect image for your next step.</p>

			<h2>Your Session, Step by Step</h2>
			<ol class="list">
				<li><strong>Planning:</strong> We’ll start by discussing your vision and goals for the session. Whether it’s through DMs or a quick call, we’ll go over everything—from the style of photos you want to what to wear and where we’ll shoot.</li>
				<li><strong>Your Session:</strong> Relax and enjoy the experience. I’ll guide you through poses and expressions that feel natural and authentic, making sure you look your best while keeping the session pressure-free. It’s not just about taking photos—it’s about capturing the real you in a way that feels effortless and enjoyable.</li>
				<li><strong>Delivery:</strong> After the session, you’ll receive a same-day photo gift—a beautifully edited photo to take home immediately. Within 1–3 days of selecting your favorites from the proof gallery, I’ll deliver the final, fully retouched images that you’ll love for years to come.</li>
