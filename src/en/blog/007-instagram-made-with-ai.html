<p>Instagram has recently introduced a feature that detects if the photos you've uploaded as Stories or Posts are made with any sort of AI technology and marks them as <strong>Made with AI</strong>. It obviously isn't working as intended and so it currently marks non-AI edited images as "Made with AI" as well, and it gives false negatives in the other dorection as well. The best thing is that you cannot remove this label once it's marked by Instagram.</p>
<p>Here's a quick tip on how to make sure your uploaded content doesnt get marked as Made with AI by Instagram's algorithms.</p>

<h2>How to Bypass Instagram's "Made with AI" Label</h2>
<p>Just to mention how this is happening: Instagram can see the metadata of your images and can read potential information that programs left in there as well as the editing program you've used to create the final image. If it sees anything suspicious, it will mark your image as "Made with AI". So to circumvent this, we'll need to purge the metadata before uploading; simple as that.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Option 1</h3>
<p><strong>Use an online to purge metadata from your image.</strong></p>
<p>I am totally not affiliated with any of the services below, but after a quick Google search on online tools, I got the following:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li><a href="https://pics.io/metadata-remover">https://pics.io/metadata-remover</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/delete-exif.php">https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/delete-exif.php</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't like any of these, just Google <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=remove+metadata+online">remove metadata online</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Option 2</h3>
<p><strong>Do it yourself.</strong></p>
<p>In Photoshop or Paint or any of your preferred photo editing software (this excludes Lightroom), open your final photo, select all, copy, then create a new document with the same dimensions and paste. Easy. That's Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+N, Enter, Ctrl+V in Photoshop on Windows. Mac users replace <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>'s with <kbd>Cmd</kbd>'s.</p>
<p>What we're doing here is we copy the image information, create a brand new document with no metadata in it and pasting in our original pixels (without any metadata).</p>

<hr>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So long as this feature exists and it's in this highly inaccurate state, it's best to go the extra mile and remove the metadata so Instagram cannot make fake claims over our content. For personal projects, it may not be as big of a deal, but imagine <a href="/en/blog/instagram-collab/">collaborating</a> with a bigger account or a company and having "Made with AI" displayed under your names. I would certainly not want this to happen.</p>
