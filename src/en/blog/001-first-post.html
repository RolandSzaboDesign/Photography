<p>Hey, and welcome to my Blog. It's finally happening.</p>
<p>I've always fancied writing, even though I couldn't do it properly, ever. Back when I was a freelance web designer I used to have a web design blog, where I loved to share my toughts and create value for people. The goal is the same with this blog.</p>
<p>I'm currently doing an Advent Photo Tips series on my Instagram stories, and I've been writing proper captions to my latest few Instagram posts. This made me realize that I have quite a lot to say about photography. However, I feel like Instagram stories are not the right medium and format to do so. Hence the inception of my Blog.</p>
<p><strong>So what can you expect?</strong> In short, I'll be writing about everything photography: tutorials, personal experiences, behind the scenes, maybe even some gear reviews? Who knows! I'll definitely want to keep the writing format friendly and direct, and the length down to just a few minutes for each blog post. No fuss and sugarcoating, hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>Think I should cover a certain topic?</strong> Well, if you'd really like my opinion, be sure to tell me about it on Instagram, and I'll cook something up. I'm definitely open for ideas on what you want to see.</p>
<p>Happy reading, and swing by often!</p>
