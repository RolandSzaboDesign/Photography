<p>Yeah, it's happening... finally!</p>
<p>A short backstory: I used to run a blog on web design when I was starting out, and it went for a good number of years. I loved the idea of having my thoughts put into words and that I could show them to the world.</p>
<p>On my new photography blog, you can expect short, helpful articles about photography, portraiture, posing, communication, and all kinds of geeky stuff.</p>
<p>I'm a very technical photographer and I love talking about it, so this Blog might very well become my playground for putting my thoughts into words.</p>
<p>Happy reading, and check back often! If you'd like me to write about a certain topic, feel free to <a href="mailto:hi@rolandszabo.photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let me know about it!</a></p>
