<p>So, you want to sell your car. Great! The question is, do you <strong>really want to sell it</strong>, or just keep listing it for half a year? If it’s the latter, just snap a photo in a crowded parking lot at night, with flash, while holding a McDonald's coffee in your left hand.</p>
<p>But if your goal is to sell it quickly and for a good price, keep reading! In just a few minutes, I’ll teach you how to take decent car photos—even with a phone—so buyers won’t run away crying at the sight of your ad.</p>
<p><strong>90% of buyers decide whether to click on an ad based on the images alone. No matter how good your car is, if your photos are bad, buyers will simply scroll past.</strong> Let me show you how to avoid this!</p>

<h2>The Essential Photo List</h2>
<p>If potential buyers have to guess what your car looks like, they won’t waste time asking questions—they’ll just move on. That’s why you need to showcase every important detail right from the start.</p>

<h2>🚨 The Worst Car Photography Mistakes – Avoid These!</h2>
<p>If you only remember one thing from this article, let it be this!</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>❌ Car tilted, distorted with wide-angle lens</strong><br>
		If your car looks like it belongs in a cartoon, it won’t help your sale.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>❌ Blurry, overexposed, or too dark</strong><br>
		You're not making a movie poster—you want people to see the condition of your car.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>❌ Other cars or trash bins in the background</strong><br>
		If buyers have to guess which car is yours, that’s not a good sign. Also, make sure there aren’t random poles growing out of your car’s roof.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>❌ Tires facing the camera</strong><br>
		Always turn the steering wheel so the rims face the camera, not the tires.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>✅ How to Photograph a Car Properly</h2>
<p>Now you know what NOT to do. But how do you make the most of your photos? Check out these good examples and follow these simple rules!</p>

<h3>Before the Shoot – Prepare Properly!</h3>
<p>A good photoshoot doesn’t start when you press the shutter button. If your car is a dusty, coffee-stained mess and your camera lens has a three-day-old greasy fingerprint, even the best angles won’t save your shots.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Wash the car inside and out!</strong><br>
		Nobody wants to see a cheeseburger stuck under the seat. A clean car always looks more valuable and well-maintained.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Remove personal belongings!</strong><br>
		That crumpled tissue pack, old charging cable, or loose coins scratching the console don’t belong in the photos.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Clean your phone’s camera lens!</strong><br>
		Seriously, at least wipe it with your shirt once. Then do it again. A greasy lens will make your photos look like they were taken through a foggy window.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Choose a good location!</strong><br>
		Either go for a clean, neutral background that keeps the focus on the car, or pick an epic backdrop that enhances the visual appeal.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Don’t forget about the license plate!</strong><br>
		If you don’t want the entire internet discussing your plate number, remove or cover it before the shoot.
	</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>During the Shoot – Lighting and Composition Rules</h3>
<p>A well-lit photo sells the car. A poorly lit one will only bring frustration when buyers keep asking if it’s silver or gray because they simply can’t tell.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Avoid wide-angle mode!</strong><br>
		If you don’t want your car to look stretched and distorted, don’t use wide-angle. If the car doesn’t fit in the frame, step back. If stepping back isn’t possible, you’ve chosen a bad location.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Don’t zoom digitally!</strong><br>
		If your phone doesn’t have a dedicated telephoto lens, walk closer instead of using digital zoom, which degrades image quality.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Hold your phone straight!</strong><br>
		You’re not making an art project—tilted shots don’t make the car look more dynamic, just unprofessional.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Keep the car level!</strong><br>
		The car should be straight in the frame, not leaning to one side. Focus on aligning the car, not the horizon.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Don’t crop out important parts!</strong><br>
		Make sure the entire car fits in the frame unless you’re taking a close-up of a specific detail.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Leave enough space around the car!</strong><br>
		Don’t fill the entire frame with the car. Leave some breathing room for a balanced composition.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Watch the background!</strong><br>
		Avoid having trees, poles, or signs appearing to "grow" out of the car’s roof.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Nothing should block the car!</strong><br>
		A fence, bush, or any object partially hiding the car makes the photo useless.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Turn the wheels correctly!</strong><br>
		Always angle the wheels so that the rims, not the tires, face the camera.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Don’t shoot from too high or too low!</strong><br>
		The best angle is usually at waist height, around the car’s beltline (headlight level).
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advanced Tips – If You Want to Step Up Your Game</h3>
<p>If you’ve mastered the basics like holding your phone properly and keeping your feet out of the frame, it’s time to take your car photography to the next level. These tips will make your photos look dealership-worthy!</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Use a polarizing filter!</strong><br>
		A CPL filter removes unwanted reflections and enhances contrast. It’s not a must, but it’s a top tool for professional car photography.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Try Portrait Mode!</strong><br>
		If your phone has a Portrait Mode, use it for a softly blurred background. Just don’t overdo it—check if the car’s outline looks natural.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Use a tripod or stabilization!</strong><br>
		A cheap tripod or even placing your phone on a backpack can help get sharper, more professional-looking shots—especially in low light (which you obviously shouldn’t be shooting in!).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Play with reflections!</strong><br>
		A clean car surface reflecting the sky or surroundings can add a premium look. Just make sure the car remains the main focus.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Shoot in RAW (if possible)!</strong><br>
		If your phone or camera allows RAW shooting, use it for better post-processing control.
	</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>Post-Processing – What to Do After the Shoot?</h3>
<p>You’ve taken a bunch of great photos? Awesome! Now comes the hardest part—don’t upload them immediately! A little post-processing and a well-written ad can make a huge difference in attracting serious buyers.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Should you blur out the license plate?</strong> <em>Not necessarily!</em><br>
		A car with a verifiable history builds trust. If the car’s background is clean, leave the plate visible and mention it in your ad.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Remove bad shots!</strong><br>
		If a photo is too dark, too bright, blurry, or just doesn’t look good—delete it! Only upload the best ones.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Crop, straighten, and adjust!</strong><br>
		Minor edits can help showcase the car better. Make sure it looks natural and well-presented.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Don’t overdo the filters!</strong><br>
		A little correction is fine, but if your car looks like a video game render, you’ve gone too far.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>⭕ Write a proper description!</strong><br>
		Photos sell the car, but a good description seals the deal. Don’t just write, "As seen in photos, price is firm." Provide key details that help buyers decide faster.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>If you did the photography right, your listing will stand out, and you won’t have to answer the same "Yeah, it's still available" message a hundred times.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions – Used Car Photography</h2>
<div class="faqs">
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How many photos should I take of the car? &nbsp;📸</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">As many as possible, but don’t upload them all blindly! Take at least 20-30 photos to have a good selection, but only include the cleanest, best-angled shots in your listing. Even if you pay for premium packages on different platforms, don’t just dump all your photos at once!</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How many photos can I upload to used car listing websites? &nbsp;🖼️</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">
			<ul class="list tight">
				<li><strong>Használtautó.hu</strong> – The free listing allows 6 images, and for an additional 990 HUF, you can upload 12. I personally recommend paying for the 12 images. You can also upload up to 10 documents related to the car.</li>
				<li><strong>Jófogás.hu</strong> – The basic listing allows 6 images, while premium listings allow more.</li>
				<li><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong> – You can upload a maximum of 10 photos per listing.</li>
				<li><strong>Car dealerships' own websites</strong> – The limit depends on the platform, but I’d recommend uploading at least 10 images if possible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If there’s a limit, prioritize the most important photos: exterior views, dashboard, interior, trunk, odometer reading, and any visible damages.</p>
		</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">What kind of location should I choose for photography? &nbsp;📍</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">
			<p>Either minimalist or cinematic—there’s no middle ground.</p>
			<ul class="tight">
				<li>✅ An empty parking lot or a clean wall makes a perfect background, ensuring nothing distracts from the car.</li>
				<li>✅ If you want something more visually striking, find a scenic or natural location, but make sure the car remains the focal point.</li>
				<li>🚫 DO NOT take photos in residential parking lots, near garbage bins, or in places where other cars interfere with the frame!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">When is the best time to take photos? &nbsp;🌞</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">
			<ul class="tight">
				<li>✅ Morning or evening – The light during sunrise and sunset is much softer, preventing harsh shadows and highlights on the car’s surface.</li>
				<li>✅ On cloudy days or in the shade – The lighting will be more even, avoiding harsh reflections.</li>
				<li>🚫 Do not take photos in residential parking lots, near trash bins, or in places where other cars interfere with the shot!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">What camera should I use? &nbsp;📷</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">
			<ul class="list tight">
				<li>A modern smartphone is enough if you follow composition and lighting rules.</li>
				<li>Don’t use wide-angle mode! It will distort the car’s shape. Only use it indoors, and even then, with caution!</li>
				<li>If your phone has a dedicated telephoto lens, use it for classic three-quarter angles!</li>
				<li>If you have a professional camera, a 35-50mm focal length (full-frame equivalent) is ideal!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How should I edit the photos? &nbsp;🛠️</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">
			<ul class="tight">
				<li>✅ Crop and straighten the images – The car should be level, and no important parts should be cut off.</li>
				<li>✅ Adjust brightness if necessary – If the image is slightly too dark, make slight corrections.</li>
				<li>✅ Blur the license plate if needed – However, if the car has a clean history, many buyers prefer to see the plate for verification.</li>
				<li>🚫 Do not overuse filters! Nobody wants an over-contrasted, HDR-style “artistic” photo in a used car listing.</li>

		<div class="faq__answer">
			<p>Photos sell the car, but a good description reinforces the decision!</p>
			<ul class="tight">
				<li>✅ Include all important details – Year, mileage, engine type, equipment.</li>
				<li>✅ Highlight the positives – For example, “New brakes, recently serviced.”</li>
				<li>✅ If there are flaws, don’t hide them! – Mention things like “Some cosmetic wear, but mechanically sound.”</li>
				<li>🚫 Don’t use generic text! (“Perfect condition, price is firm.”) That won’t help you sell the car.</li>

	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How available should I be for buyers? &nbsp;📞</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">
			<ul class="tight">
				<li>✅ Provide multiple contact options – Phone number + email + Messenger is a good combo.</li>
