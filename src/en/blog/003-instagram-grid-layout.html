<p>I thought I'd give you my two cents on these so-called perfect grids that people strive for on Instagram, and why they're a disaster for your creativity.</p>

<h2>A few Examples on these pre-planned Grid Layouts</h2>
<ul class="list">
	<li><strong>Three similar images in a row</strong> - It looks really good, though, not gonna lie. But have you ever thought about the stunning moments you're missing just to adhere to this absurd rule?</li>
	<li><strong>Patterns in your grid</strong> - Checkerboard, rows, columns, diagonals even... "Creativity" really doesn't know boundaries. Only this is not creativity but the exact opposite. Is our storytelling so one-dimensional that we must follow a predetermined pattern?</li>
	<li><strong>Thumbnail puzzles</strong> - Combining three (or God forbid even 6 or 9) thumbnails into a single image? It might be visually interesting on our profiles, but guess what? It's a disaster on our followers' home feeds. Are we showcasing our skills or making a puzzle that nobody asked for?</li>
	<li><strong>Adding borders to your photos</strong> - Not the deadliest of sins, but definitely a limitation is adding borders to your photos so in your feed your images look more spaced out. Ever heard about dark mode, though? What color are your borders, exactly?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's make a few things clear:</h2>
<h3>1. Noone looks at your Profile Feed twice</h3>
<p>Your profile feed is a one-time visual. The only time someone views your profile grid on Instagram is when they start following you. People just open the app to consume content, they keep scrolling through posts and stories and that's it. If they come across a badly cropped photo that might very well look good in your feed, they may only see indistinct parts of your image, and they might just unfollow you at a glance.</p>
<blockquote class="content-box">
	<p>"Oh while I don't forget, let me search for this random creator I've been following to see what cool new stuff they've done to their grid layout recently. It must look super interesting!"</p>
	<footer class="text-right"><em><cite>Absolutely Noone</cite></em></footer>
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Instagram is Not your Portfolio</h3>
<p>It's merely a tool among hundreds of social media apps where you can feature your work and connect with your audience. If you consider it your portfolio, where only your best work goes in an orderly fashion, you're seriously missing out. What if with the rise of larger and larger smartphones, Meta one day decides to change the layout to a 4 column one? They already tested this once back in 2017. Ain't gonna be a fun ride having to start all over again.</p>

<h2>I've been there, too!</h2>
<p>Yes, I am guilty of doing this myself, too. Actually I've done ALL of the above, believe it or not. I quite enjoyed doing it, until they bit me in the butt-butt.</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>There was a time when I was posting 3 photos at a time that were similar in theme or style. When I posted three at the same time so that my profile grid doesn't break, my followers would see three posts in succession. Plus I was experiencing lower reach beause of "spammy" behaviour. It wasn't great to live with this limitation when I only had 1 great photo to share and not three. Not to mention, having to explain to your model who wants to do a collab with you, that you can only do the collab in 2 days when your row gets completed, is just outright ridiculous and the absolute opposite of professional.</li>
	<li>Still, in a galaxy far-far away, I used to put borders on my images because it was "unique" *chuckles*. It was limiting in two ways: The first photo of every gallery needed to be a square crop, which was already quite frustrating sometimes. However, I got the real kick in the balls when a rather large account who I worked for wanted to collaborate with me, but my pretty borders didn't fit their feeds. So, I got left out, losing tens of thousands in potential reach.</li>
	<li>I used to have a panorama account where I would post three photos as a panorama that only looked good in my profile, but when you viewed them in your feed, you'd see weirdly cropped landscapes that didn't make sense as a photo. I'm so glad I'm not doing that anymore.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The earlier you quit, the better</h2>
<p>Seriously, it's time to rethink what's better. Conforming to the stupid limitations of the 3-col grid and trying to be unique in noone's but our own eyes? Or unleashing our creativity without any boundaries and posting whenever you have something to show to the world. A photo that will touch people. A story that will deeply resonate with someone. A body of work that will get noticed.</p>
<p>Finish your current row, complete your current diagonal pattern, and then just let go. I can't put into words what it feels like when this creative constraint gets lifted off your shoulders. But you'll thank me later, I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
