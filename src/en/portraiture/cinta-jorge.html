intro: It all started as a stranger photo I took of this lovely couple that I showed them on the streets. They loved it so much that 3 days later we were on a fully fledged photoshoot chasing the sunset in the City Park in Budapest. They reminded me at the beginning of the shoot that they're not good with posing, but I assured them that all I wanted to see is just them being them, as a couple in a park, doing couple-y things. Thanks to this, they could easily relax during the shoot, and I was able to capture some gorgeous photos of them.
