intro: One of my earlier film portrait shoots with the lovely Eszter, shot on Fujifilm Velvia 50 slidefilm. We didn't have much sunlight for the majority of the photoshoot, but we had an epic sunset in the last 10 minutes. We actually shot this in early June this year, but we had to wait for almost 3 months for the development fluid to be available due to a worldwide shortage.
