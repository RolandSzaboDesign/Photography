intro: Eszter joined me on a sunny winter day to test drive a bunch of vintage lenses, including my Sonnar 135mm, the old Helios 44-2 and the Tessar 50mm. These are some of our favorites. The more I shoot with analog optics, the better I feel I'm getting at them. This session was a great practice for me, where we've also made some amazing photos, together.
