intro: The story of Alíz and Ádám started with a stranger photo at Kisoroszi, where I aproached them to take their photo. They loved the photos so much, that a couple months later Ádám gifted Alíz with a photoshoot for their anniversary. The photo story we crafted together tells their story of how they became lovers. The images below are mere samples from the photo set.
