intro: We went out with Eperke to test out my newly acquired Carl Zeiss Jena DDR Sonnar 135mm f/3.5 MC vintage lens. After I took the very first shot, we were both literally in awe; me, because the lens was so incredibly sharp and the colors were simply amazing, I wouldn't believe my eyes; and Eperke, because she already liked the very first photo of her. Needless to say, the rest of the shoot went without a breeze. All portraits were shot with at the widest aperture of the lens, and the colors were just ever so slightly edited.
