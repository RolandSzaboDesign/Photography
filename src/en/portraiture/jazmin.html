intro: We had a very challenging photoshoot with Jázmin at Hárshegy, at which I only shot with my 50-year-old vintage lenses. Most of the shots were taken with the Helios 44M-4 and 44-2 soviet lenses, and we've also shot some photos with the Carl Zeiss Jena Tessar 50mm glass. The swirly background bokeh gives a very interesting, Wonderland-like feel to the photos.
