		<h1>Portrait Photo Walks</h1>
	</header>
	<p>I do outdoor photo walks in Budapest with individuals, couples and families to create everlasting memories.</p>

	<h2>What is a Photo Walk?</h2>
	<p>It's a laid-back, no-pressure walking-talking-shooting experience with yours truly. We agree on a time and place to meet, and go from there. We can shoot more and talk less, or the other way around, it's up to you.</p>
	<p>During the photoshoot I'll gladly assist you with locations, posing and bad jokes.</p>
	<p></p>

	<h2>Questions You Might Ask</h2>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Where do we walk?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">We can walk and shoot wherever you want in Budapest. I prefer the inner districts for photographic possibilities, but I don't shy away from going to a nearby nature reserve or forest to take more close-to-nature photos.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How long is a photo walk?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">It usually ranges from 30 minutes to 120 minutes or even more. I'm pretty versatile on time, so you can decide if you just want a few headshots taken or stay longer and visit multiple locations and even change outfits.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How much will it cost?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">The photo walk and the shooting are free, you'll only need to pay for the images you select for editing and retouching afterwards.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How about editing and retouching?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">All photos you select after the shoot will be color-graded in a way that matches your personality, the locations, and the theme of the shoot. Retouching includes removing skin imperfections and unnecessary flying hairs.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Will I get the raw photos, too?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">I don't hand out unedited photos, only processed ones that reflect my personal editing style. This is to prevent people getting an inaccurate representation of the quality of my work.</div>
