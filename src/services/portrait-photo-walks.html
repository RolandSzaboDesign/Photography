	<h2>What is a Photo Walk?</h2>
	<p>It's a laid-back, no-pressure walking-talking-shooting experience with yours truly. We agree on a time and place to meet, and go from there. We can shoot more and talk less, or the other way around, it's up to you.</p>

	<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
	<ul class="how-it-works">
		<li class="how-it-works__item">
			<h3>Preparation</h3>
			<p>Before we get into things, you should have a basic idea for your photoshoot; what kind of photos you'd need. Be sure to send me any inspiration you like, including poses, facial expressions, places or environments, or just general concepts. Based on your preferences, we'll create a moodboard or a specific shot list that we can refer to during your photoshoot.</p>

		</li>
		<li class="how-it-works__item">
			<h3>Photoshoot</h3>
			<p>During the photoshoot I'll gladly assist you with location ideas, help you with posing and giving prompts, and tell a bunch of bad jokes.</p>
			<p>We don't need to strictly adhere to our moodboard, so if you find an interesting location that strikes your imagination, say it loud and we can take a detour.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="how-it-works__item">
			<h3>Delivery</h3>
			<p>For the sake of same-day delivery, you'll receive my 1 favorite photo of the day, edited and retouched, at the end of the shooting day, for free.</p>
			<p>After this, I'll go through the photos we took and do the initial culling. This means I'll delete all the photos that are blurry, duplicate, or unbecoming.</p>
			<p>Once this is done, I'll send all the remaining photos for you to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch. These photos you initially get will be in black-and-white, small size and watermarked. The reason for <abbr title="blank-and-white">B/W</abbr> is for you to better concentrate on the composition, your facial expression and pose rather than the colors which will be processed later anyways.</p>
			<p>Once you come back to me with your selection, please allow me 1-3 days to finish editing and retouching your photos. You'll receive your photos digitally in a Google Drive folder. I'll set the folder to be publicly available (for those who have the link), so you don't need to give me your email address.</p>

	</ul>

	<h2>Pricing</h2>
	<p>I'm not a fan of packages, because they don't fit everyone's needs. </p>

	<h2>Questions You Might Ask</h2>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Where do we walk?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">We can walk and shoot wherever you want in Budapest. I prefer the inner districts for photographic possibilities, but I don't shy away from going to a nearby nature reserve or forest to take more close-to-nature photos.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How long is a photo walk?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">It usually ranges from 30 minutes to 120 minutes or even more. I'm pretty versatile on time, so you can decide if you just want a few headshots taken or stay longer and visit multiple locations and even change outfits.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How much will it cost?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">The photo walk and the shooting are free, you'll only need to pay for the images you select for editing and retouching afterwards.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">How about editing and retouching?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">All photos you select after the shoot will be color-graded in a way that matches your personality, the location, and the theme of the shoot. Retouching includes removing skin imperfections and unnecessary flying hairs.</div>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Will I get the raw photos, too?</summary>
		<div class="faq__answer">I don't hand out unedited photos, only processed ones that reflect my personal editing style. This is to prevent people getting an inaccurate representation of the quality of my work.</div>
	</details>
