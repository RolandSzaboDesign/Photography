<p>Hey everyone! So, after happily clicking away for three years, I thought, why not turn my photography chatter into a blog and share my love of photography with more of you? Plus, it might just help me kick that impostor syndrome in the ass – fingers crossed!</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the plan: This blog is the backstage pass to all things photography. Expect a healthy dose of geeky camera talk, sneak peeks behind my past projects, and some killer tips to level up your photo game. Okay, that started to sound a bit marketingy – my bad.</p>
<p>Picture my upcoming blog posts as a laid-back chat over a cup of coffee – short, sweet, and no unnecessary fuss. Just my thoughts, mostly unplugged.</p>
<p>I'll adjust my homepage in the coming days, so you can see if there's anything new on the Blog. If you'd like me to write about a certain topic, feel free to <a href="mailto:hi@rolandszabo.photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let me know about it</a>!</p>
<p>I'll be sprucing up the homepage soon to reflect changes on the Blog, so keep an eye out for new stuff. And hey, if there's a topic on your mind that you want my thoughts on, give me a shout! This blog is for all of us.</p>
<p>Happy reading, and don't be a stranger – swing by often!</p>
