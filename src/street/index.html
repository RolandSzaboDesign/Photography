		<p>Ever since I picked up my camera, I've been regularly going out on photo walks in my city.</p>
		<p>It's great practice to just go out and observe your surroundings for mundane things happening. Also, the long kilometers of walking keep me moderately fit.</p>
		<p>I'm on an mission to stop taking the average "touristy" shots, and focus my images more around art and storytelling.</p>
