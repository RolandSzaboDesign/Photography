			<p>Hey, I'm Roland, nice to meet you! I'm a 32-year-old aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary. I used to shoot on my phone a lot, and I picked up a digital camera about a good year-and-a-half ago.</p>
			<p>I got very close to technology at a rather young age, and I've always been fascinated of the ways I was able to create. I've tried multiple avenues of creativity, including music and design, but photography has definitely become the one I got to feel the most fulfilled in. The ability to capture moments and share them with others is what drives me on this journey.</p>
			<p>I've been shooting APS-C since the day I started photography, first with the Sony Alpha 6000 for a good year, then I upgraded to the a6400. I have an army of <a href="/gear">lenses and accessories</a> for almost all situations.</p>
			<p>When not out shooting or editing, <a href="https://rolandszabo.design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I design webthings</a> for a living, and I play video- and board games for fun. My other hobbies are cardistry and getting quicker at solving the 3×3 Rubik's cube.</p>
			<p>Don't be afraid to <a href="/contact">say hello</a>!</p>
			<h2>Some Interesting Facts</h2>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>I'm an introvert.</strong> I absolutely love working with people, but my social battery can sometimes drain rather quickly.</li>
				<li><strong>I'm a tech nerd.</strong> I love talking about technology and techniques in photography, so if you pop a question, be ready for the long answer.</li>
				<li><strong>I'm a perfectionist.</strong> I strive for the utmost precision and I fight for every single detail in my work.</li>
			</ul>
