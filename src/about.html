<h1 class="title">About</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Roland, nice to meet you! I'm a 32-year-old aspiring amateur photographer from Budapest, Hungary. I used to shoot on my phone a lot, and I picked up a digital camera a good year-and-a-half ago.</p>

<p>PORTRAITS</p>
<p>I'm an incredibly empathetic human being and can relate easily with others. If you smile, I'm smiling with you. </p>
<p>I strive to capture feelings, not just looks. Taking photos about you, not of you.</p>
<p>You really are beautiful. I'm not just saying it; I'll show you instead.</p>

<p>I do photo walks in Budapest with people, couples and families to create joyful memories.</p>
