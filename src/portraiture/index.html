		<p>I love connecting with people through portrait photography.</p>
		<p>I strive to create portrait photos that reflect the model's personality. During photoshoots I talk a lot to my models to get to know them better and portray them in a way that is the most true to themselves.</p>
		<p>My favourite type of portraits is close-up headshots, where each little detail in the face adds to the whole story.</p>
