		<p class="testimonial__text">As someone who typically avoids the camera, I was not looking forward to participating in a couples shoot with my wife. However, Roland's professionalism and artistic understanding for composition helped guide the photoshoot. I felt comfortable in front of the camera and my expectations were exceeded for the entire experience. Overall, the photoshoot was quite romantic and I look forward to cherishing these forever memories with my wife.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I've been following Roland's work for a while and I really liked the portraits he made of others, so we arranged a photo shoot. He is very flexible in scheduling, so it will be easy for you to work with him. And, if this is your first portrait shoot, like me, I definitely recommend Roland, as he patiently helped with everything and we came up with the concept together. Thanks to the above, the photo shoot was a very positive experience for me, for which I would like to thank Roland once again!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Recently I became determined to push myself out of my comfort zone. I desired change. I followed Roland for several years on Instagram and messaged him on a whim to meet up for a photoshoot. Here is the real catch, I HATE standing in front of a camera. I decided I was fully committing to my leap outside of my comfort zone. From the moment of our first picture, I felt comfortable with our ability to communicate. Throughout the shoot, Roland guided me in posing and insisted on making things as comfortable as possible. By the end of the shoot, we delved into a deep conversation about fighting the battle of complacency. To grow, we must overcome our desire for perfection and embrace the areas where we are weak. For anyone considering it, I highly recommend taking that leap and booking a photoshoot with Roland. Remember, you cannot grow if you remain in your comfort zone.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I came across Roland's work on social media. I immediately followed him because of his brilliant, high-quality pictures. During our first photo shoot together, it became clear to me that I got to know not only a great photographer, but also a very kind person. The photoshoots with Roland always happen in a very good mood, you don't feel tense for a minute. Not even if you are not used to standing in front of the camera, or if you are used to the other side of the camera. His creativity is motivating and his willingness to help is rare in today's world. Whenever I talk to him, he is always happy to provide me with useful advice, motivation and encouragement. I wholeheartedly recommend Roland, working with him is a delightful experience!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">When I went to take photos with Roland for the first time, I was a little afraid of it all; I'm not used to someone else taking pictures of me. It was very easy to find common ground with him, I didn't have to strain, and what helped me the most was that he was open to my preferences. He really treated me as an equal partner during the brainstorming, photography, and final selection process. Since then, we have taken photos together several times, and I strongly recommend him to those who want pictures of themselves that really reflect their best side!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Throughout my life, I was nervous a lot, I was afraid to stand in front of people and it was difficult for me to smile sincerely. One day I came across Roli's photography page, and he himself and his pictures were very nice. I was very happy that he responded quickly and we were even able to go for a portrait shoot that week. I was very nervous at the beginning, because I thought it was impossible to take a good photo of me, but he was easily able to mane great photos. He quickly created comfort with his many jokes, so my real smile immediately appeared, and we achieved some sensational portraits. I can recommend him to everyone, Roland is a great company who creates wonderful pictures and memories. I have taken portrait photos with him many times already, both individually and as a couple, and every time with him is a recharge.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Life brought Roland and I together a few months ago, when he approached us unexpectedly on a pleasant spring afternoon to take a few photos of me and my girlfriend from afar. We were completely delighted, the pictures turned out great! After seeing his other work, I was sure that if I needed quality photos, I would go to him. It soon became so, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations! During the photo shoot, he ensured a very relaxed atmosphere, we could easily find common ground, and he was able to perfectly capture my ideas. I was particularly satisfied with his flexibility and speed in terms of scheduling the appointment, the photography itself, and the images I received. I can only recommend Roland to everyone! And as soon as you see him using the light… well, you should really see him!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">It's been the second time I had the pleasure of working with Roland. I admit, I was surprised when he invited me to a spontaneous photo shoot on the street a few months ago. I never considered myself photogenic, I was convinced that it was almost impossible to take a favorable picture of me. On the contrary, it was completely refuted on both occasions. The photoshoots were in a great atmosphere, and I am simply there and back for the end result. I also consider it important to mention the person of Roland; he is kind, patient, and tries to create a self-effacing atmosphere during the entire duration of the photo shoot. I can wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone who wants a little self-confidence boost, a good mood, and of course wonderful pictures!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I've always loved standing in front of the camera with a smile, so I was particularly pleased with this unusual, creative photo shoot with light painting. The entire photo shoot was fast-paced, the ideas followed each other, and the cold and the wind took a back seat. The informal brainstorming with Roland before the photoshoot lifted the mood even more. I have never participated in such a creative and special photo shoot before, so I was able to enrich myself with very interesting and inspiring new experiences - and of course wonderful pictures. The photoshoot was edgy and elegant at the same time, so I strongly recommend it to anyone who feels like showing their creativity. I hope that I will have the opportunity to participate in a similar creative project in the future!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I have always been the anxious type, and this was no different before the photo shoot with Roland. I had never been on a shoot before, I didn't know what the joint work would be like, how I should pose for the pictures, or how much I would be able to let myself go. But this excitement passed after the first few minutes. It was great to talk for a few minutes before we got into the shoot, so I could settle in for the occasion better. I felt very comfortable with Roland's encouragement along the way, and his jokes were also good, which helped me a lot to be able to smile honestly! I've never had so many good pictures taken of me before, and I couldn't wait to get them. All in all, I very much enjoyed the photo shoot, it was a perfect first-time experience, and I hope I will have the opportunity to do more like this!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Before the photo shoot, I was a little afraid of whether the photos would turn out well, since I don't have much experience in modeling and so far only friends and acquaintances have taken photos of me. I moved out of my comfort zone on this occasion, but at the same time the style itself (vintage, retro) was very close to me, so I still felt comfortable taking photos. This was perhaps the first time I had the earliest time to dissolve during a photo shoot. I was glad that Roli was interested in my opinion, he showed me the photos, he was interested in whether I had any ideas about the location or posing. I liked that we worked together to create these wonderful images, and I didn't feel like I had to cope with the task alone. Overall, I can say that Roli does a very high-quality and creative job during the photography and post-production!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I took part in a photo shoot with Roland for the first time at the Christmas market, which quickly turned into a friendly conversation with an extremely good atmosphere. I was able to open up almost immediately, as he created an extremely safe and pleasant atmosphere from the very first moment. Letting go of all my inhibitions, I could smile at the camera, which was not characteristic of me before, but thanks to Roland, I was able to get to know this side of myself as well. Since then, I've had the opportunity to take part in a joint photo shoot with him twice, both of which also went very smoothly, and after the pictures I received, my long-lost self-confidence started to return, thanks to Roland!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I often have inhibitions when someone takes my photo, so I was a little worried about whether I would feel comfortable with the whole process and whether I would like the pictures. Well, I have to say that it was a completely positive disappointment for me. I was sure it would be an incredible experience because it was my first proper photo shoot, but I didn't expect how much self-confidence shooting with Roland would give me. Every picture I received was amazing; I was overwhelmed by how beautiful each one was. The atmosphere was great throughout the photoshoot, with lots of laughter, all combined with professionalism.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I have had the opportunity to work with Roland twice so far, and both times were unforgettable experiences. The first time I didn't know what to expect, especially not how to pose in front of the camera. However, thanks to Roland's humor, I forgot that I was at a photo shoot from the very first moment! When my partner and I went to see him, we were afraid that it would be strange to kiss in front of the camera, but even there he was humorous throughout, bringing out our natural, intimate moments. As a result, the photos don't show posed moments but radiate real love, which we always look at with a smile. In short, I can only recommend Roland!</p>

To be honest, I was very nervous because I never feel comfortable in front of the cameras, even though as a coach I really have nothing to hide. I didn't know Roland either, and that didn't make the situation any easier either. Thank God, working with Roland exceeded all my expectations, I managed to completely relax from the very beginning of the photo shoot. I am very satisfied with the pictures; Roland was able to show me a completely new face of mine, for which I am very grateful.

I really liked his work from the beginning; the pictures, colors, and everything matched our expectations. At the beginning of the photoshoot, we were a bit shy, but Roland was very friendly, we talked and laughed a lot, so we got along easily, and we got incredibly good pictures. Budapest means a lot to us, and Roland perfectly captured our shared experience.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Honestly, I'm not the smiling type. Also, ever since I was a kid, I've been uncomfortable being held up by a camera lens. And this was only compounded by the slightly irritated request from the other side of the device: 'Smile a little!' Fortunately, as the years went by, the anxiety in front of the camera lessened. However, I owe the real breakthrough to Roland. Already during our first photo shoot, he managed to get me to relax, he kept instructing me, and the results are beautiful. I can't wait to create something beautiful together again, starring my hats!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I was very nervous at the beginning of Roland's portrait photography session because I had never participated in a similar event before. The scariest thing was that my inadequate posing skills would lead to uncomfortable situations. Those concerns evaporated as soon as I shook hands with the smiling and friendly gentleman. From the moment we met, I hung out with a friend, joked, and we brainstormed all kinds of photo ideas together. There was no pressure, no stress. To my surprise, the photos turned out extremely well, the early autumn colors look beautiful! Not only did I overcome all of my posing concerns, but I saw myself through a whole new lens. It was an interesting experience to look at the movements, gestures, and emotions from the outside. I owe Roland a debt of gratitude for that.</p>

Well, I could hardly choose from more than 200 pictures (made by Roland with joy and singing). He always found the right angles and places and was particularly open to my ideas throughout. Roland gave fully comprehensible and easy-to-follow instructions and helped me to make sure that the images came to life exactly as I envisioned them.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Shooting with Roland was simply fantastic. He's really kind, helpful, and always eager to capture moments in the most creative way. I can happily recommend him. I can guarantee that you'll be in for an extraordinary experience if you're choosing him. He's not only attentive, but highly professional (and by the way, his sense of humour is inimitable)!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Working with Roland has always been very fun and smooth, all of our photoshoots took place in a light mood. I could approach him with more creative and difficult concepts and Roland could make my ideas come to life with ease, in the form of staggering photo sets. I can highly recommend him.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">The mood of our photoshoots with Roland was super laid-back from the very beginning. It was easy to relax, I didn't feel inhibited at all, and we've had great laughs that would sometimes break (or make!) a photo. Thanks to the chilled vibes, we've made amazing photos that I happily shared with my friends and on social media.</p>

Not to mention, as a beginner photographer, I got to learn lots of new things from him, which I'll certainly use in my upcoming work.</p>
