Great atmosphere and wonderful photos are guaranteed!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Anyone who has been flirting with the idea of appearing in front of a camera for a long time, but has inhibitions and does not dare to act, is in the right place with Roland. With his humor, dedication and passion for photography, everyone can feel safe and valued. And for those who are braver and want an extra experience, I can highly recommend analog photography. It's exciting that we can't see the image on the screen right away, and we have to wait for the final result until they are developed. Unbelievably special and atmospheric pictures can be created this way!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">To summarize my experience working with Roland in one word - EXCEPTIONAL. With prime organizational skills, he ensured we were properly prepared for our photoshoot day; he even scouted our location at sunrise, prior to our photoshoot day! (Now that's some serious commitment!) During the photoshoot, he was very patient and thorough in ensuring we had gotten the very best possible photos out of every angle, pose, and location. After the shoot, he spent countless hours editing our gallery to utter perfection, even taking into consideration my personal preferences and business needs for our photos. I also sincerely believe it's impossible not to feel like a supermodel while shooting with Roland because he will be verbally cheering you on from start to finish! Even though our shoot spanned hours, his contagious positive energy supply never gave out, and I should also mention this was an early morning sunrise shoot, literally taking place at the crack of dawn. Book your own photoshoot with Roland TODAY. I can confidently endorse Roland with this promise - you will not be disappointed!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">We were sure from the very beginning that the photo shoot with Roland would be in a very good mood, but we did not expect that we would come on the same wavelength so soon and have such a good time. Before the photoshoot, we thoroughly discussed what kind of pictures we wanted and where, in which Roland was absolutely cooperative. He went out of his way to get the best pictures for us. His flexibility and precision were due to his professionalism, he was open to any changes that might arise in the meantime and he listened to all our special requests. The photo shoot itself took place in an extremely relaxed, yet dynamic atmosphere. We received a lot of instructions from Roland during the photo shoot, which contributed even more to the end result of the photos, which really speak for themselves. At the end of the photo shoot, we received one of the finalized photos as a gift on the very day of the photoshoot, and he had finalized the pictures we selected in just a few days. We wholeheartedly recommend Roland to all those who want to capture their special events and moments in high-quality pictures, during a photo shoot with a good atmosphere, with a professional photographer.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I met Roland at the beginning of the year when he approached me at the street, and we casually took some pictures, which turned out amazing. A few months after that I had a very big day in my art career, where just before the exhibition, he spent the whole morning with me, patiently taking pictures of me with all my paintings. The surroundings weren't very helpful, just a regular street in Budapest, but he managed to find the perfect backgrounds, and matching colours with my artworks, and the outfit I put on that day. It was a pleasure to work with him, and the results are simply amazing.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Although this was not my first experience on the other side of Roli's camera, I tend to stress on such occasions. However, after about 5 minutes, it was as if I had been replaced. His usual jokes and banter always liven up a photoshoot like this. Since I was particularly excited about the airport theme, it was a great experience for me to see how many planes landed right above us. We laughed a lot, and enjoyed the process a lot. But my favorite thing is that, despite the fact that I don't have specific ideas about photos, I always end up with beautiful pictures that I really like. It was by far the best photography experience I've ever had.</p>

He was curious about my ideas; we figured out where to take good pictures together (of course, I relied mostly on his expertise, which I didn't regret). He also talked about the lenses he uses, why we do what we do, and gave tips for poses, so I could try out which ones are comfortable for me. His humor is very infectious, he cracked a few jokes even while taking the pictures, which made the smiles and laughter in all my photos genuine and not at all forced. I can only recommend Roland, because the result of working together with him is guaranteed satisfaction.</p>

I'd tried a lot of photographers before, but since I've known Roli, I travel across the country several times a year, because he's the photographer everyone is looking for. He crafts photos of you that _you_ want, he doesn't interfere with your ideas, but he provides professional advice to make your pictures as great as possible. If you don't have any ideas, no problem; he's helpful in everything, and he's also a good-hearted, funny, and above all fair person, with whom you can easily relax, and thus the photoshoot goes smoothly. I can recommend Roland to everyone even from 200+ km away!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Recently I became determined to push myself out of my comfort zone. I desired change. I followed Roland for several years on Instagram and messaged him on a whim to meet up for a photoshoot. Here is the real catch, I HATE standing in front of a camera. I decided I was fully committing to my leap outside of my comfort zone. From the moment of our first picture, I felt comfortable with our ability to communicate. Throughout the shoot, Roland guided me in posing and insisted on making things as comfortable as possible. By the end of the shoot, we delved into a deep conversation about fighting the battle of complacency. To grow, we must overcome our desire for perfection and embrace the areas where we are weak. For anyone considering it, I highly recommend taking that leap and booking a photoshoot with Roland. Remember, you cannot grow if you remain in your comfort zone.</p>

I was very nervous at the beginning, because I thought it was impossible to take a good photo of me, but he was easily able to mane great photos. He quickly created comfort with his many jokes, so my real smile immediately appeared, and we achieved some sensational portraits. I can recommend him to everyone, Roland is a great company who creates wonderful pictures and memories.

It soon became so, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations!

I admit, I was surprised when he invited me to a spontaneous photo shoot on the street a few months ago. I never considered myself photogenic, I was convinced that it was almost impossible to take a favorable picture of me. On the contrary, it was completely refuted on both occasions. The photoshoots were in a great atmosphere, and I am simply there and back for the end result. I also consider it important to mention the person of Roland; he is kind, patient, and always creates an intimate atmosphere during the entire duration of the photo shoot.

The entire photo shoot was fast-paced, ideas followed ideas, and the cold and the wind took a back seat. The informal brainstorming with Roland before the photoshoot lifted the mood even more. I have never participated in such a creative and special photo shoot before, so I was able to enrich myself with very interesting and inspiring new experiences - and of course wonderful pictures. The photoshoot was edgy and elegant at the same time, so I strongly recommend it to anyone who feels like showing their creativity.

		<p class="testimonial__text">I have always been the anxious type, and this was no different before the photo shoot with Roland. I had never been on a shoot before, I didn't know what the joint work would be like, how I should pose for the pictures, or how much I would be able to let myself go. But this excitement passed after the first few minutes. It was great to talk for a few minutes before we got into the shoot, so I could settle in for the occasion better. I felt very comfortable with Roland's encouragement along the way, and his jokes were also good, which helped me a lot to be able to smile honestly! I've never had so many good pictures taken of me before, and I couldn't wait to get them. All in all, I very much enjoyed the photo shoot, it was a perfect first-time experience, and I hope I will have the opportunity to do more like this!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Before the photo shoot, I was a little afraid of whether the photos would turn out well, since I don't have much experience in modeling and so far only friends and acquaintances have taken photos of me. I moved out of my comfort zone on this occasion, but at the same time the style itself (vintage, retro) was very close to me, so I still felt comfortable taking photos. This was perhaps the first time I had the earliest time to dissolve during a photo shoot. I was glad that Roli was interested in my opinion, he showed me the photos, he was interested in whether I had any ideas about the location or posing. I liked that we worked together to create these wonderful images, and I didn't feel like I had to cope with the task alone. Overall, I can say that Roli does a very high-quality and creative job during the photography and post-production!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I took part in a photo shoot with Roland for the first time at the Christmas market, which quickly turned into a friendly conversation with an extremely good atmosphere. I was able to open up almost immediately, as he created an extremely safe and pleasant atmosphere from the very first moment. Letting go of all my inhibitions, I could smile at the camera, which was not characteristic of me before, but thanks to Roland, I was able to get to know this side of myself as well. Since then, I've had the opportunity to take part in a joint photo shoot with him twice, both of which also went very smoothly, and after the pictures I received, my long-lost self-confidence started to return, thanks to Roland!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I often have inhibitions when someone takes my photo, so I was a little worried about whether I would feel comfortable with the whole process and whether I would like the pictures. Well, I have to say that it was a completely positive disappointment for me. I was sure it would be an incredible experience because it was my first proper photo shoot, but I didn't expect how much self-confidence shooting with Roland would give me. Every picture I received was amazing; I was overwhelmed by how beautiful each one was. The atmosphere was great throughout the photoshoot, with lots of laughter, all combined with professionalism.</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I have had the opportunity to work with Roland twice so far, and both times were unforgettable experiences. The first time I didn't know what to expect, especially not how to pose in front of the camera. However, thanks to Roland's humor, I forgot that I was at a photo shoot from the very first moment! When my partner and I went to see him, we were afraid that it would be strange to kiss in front of the camera, but even there he was humorous throughout, bringing out our natural, intimate moments. As a result, the photos don't show posed moments but radiate real love, which we always look at with a smile. In short, I can only recommend Roland!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I was preparing for my first photo shoot. To be honest, I was very nervous because I never feel comfortable in front of the cameras, even though as a coach I really have nothing to hide. I didn't know Roland either, and that didn't make the situation any easier either. Thank God, working with Roland exceeded all my expectations, I managed to completely relax from the very beginning of the photo shoot. I am very satisfied with the pictures; Roland was able to show me a completely new face of mine, for which I am very grateful. If you're looking for a relaxed, nice, good-humored photographer with whom you'll quickly find common ground, I wholeheartedly recommend Roland! Thank you again for the opportunity, the pictures, and a great memory and gift at the same time!</p>

I really liked his work from the beginning; the pictures, colors, and everything matched our expectations. At the beginning of the photoshoot, we were a bit shy, but Roland was very friendly, we talked and laughed a lot, so we got along easily, and we got incredibly good pictures.

		<p class="testimonial__text">Honestly, I'm not the smiling type. Also, ever since I was a kid, I've been uncomfortable being held up by a camera lens. And this was only compounded by the slightly irritated request from the other side of the device: 'Smile a little!' Fortunately, as the years went by, the anxiety in front of the camera lessened. However, I owe the real breakthrough to Roland. Already during our first photo shoot, he managed to get me to relax, he kept instructing me, and the results are beautiful. I can't wait to create something beautiful together again, starring my hats!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I was very nervous before Roland's portrait photography session because I had never participated in a similar event before. The scariest thing was that my inadequate posing skills would lead to uncomfortable situations. Those concerns evaporated as soon as I shook hands with the smiling and friendly gentleman. From the moment we met, I hung out with a friend, joked, and we brainstormed all kinds of photo ideas together. There was no pressure, no stress. To my surprise, the photos turned out extremely well, the early autumn colors look beautiful! Not only did I overcome all of my posing concerns, but I saw myself through a whole new lens. It was an interesting experience to look at the movements, gestures, and emotions from the outside. I owe Roland a debt of gratitude for that.</p>
