<ol class="how-it-works">
	<li class="how-it-works__item">
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Preparation</h3>
		<p>Before we get into things, you should have a basic idea for your photoshoot; a theme or a concept, if you hany any. Be sure to send me a few inspirational photos you found online. Here are a few examples to get you started:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li><strong>Season's Special:</strong> Wonderful autumn photoshoot with falling leaves in a nearby forest or nature reserve, in an elegant autumn coat and maybe a nice accompanying hat</li>
			<li>Urban photoshoot with modern architectural backgrounds, wearing a smart outfit</li>
			<li>Close-to-nature photoshoot, wearing a long, colorful dress, located in one of the nearby nature reserves or forests in the afternoon</li>
			<li>Night photoshoot downtown with lots of colorful bokeh balls in the background, wearing a shiny, reflective top to play with the city lights</li>
			<li><em>Your creative idea goes here</em> ðŸ˜‰</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Based on your preferences, we can create a moodboard together, which we can refer to during your photoshoot.</p>
		<p>Please also have a ballpark number of photos you'd need, as we'll set the length of your photoshoot based on this.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="how-it-works__item">
		<figure class="floating-photo floating-photo--left">
			<img class="floating-photo__photo" src="/assets/images/photo-walk-02.webp" alt="Portrait Photo Walks" width="750" height="500">
			<figcaption class="floating-photo__caption"><em>Photo and edit by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/peterlakinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Lakinger</a></em></figcaption>
		</figure>
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Photoshoot</h3>
		<p>During the photoshoot, I'll gladly assist you with prompts and posing, and tell a bunch of bad jokes to bring out your best smiles. I'll do my utmost to make you comfortable during the shoot, so you don't need to worry about a thing.</p>
		<p>I'll also want to listen to your story, if you're willing to tell me; and I can also tell you my story, if you're interested. Talking and listening helps you to relax, and proceed with taking photos without inhibition or hindrances. We can create some incredibly intimate photos when we start getting to know each other better.</p>
		<p>We don't need to strictly adhere to our moodboard, so if you find an interesting location that strikes your imagination, say it loud, and we can take a detour. The best photos are the spontaneous ones!</p>
	</li>
	<li class="how-it-works__item">
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Delivery</h3>
		<p>I'm a huge advocate of giving clients something on the day of the shoot. For the sake of this, <strong>you'll receive one of my favorite photos of the shoot for free</strong>, edited and retouched, at the end of the day.</p>
		<p>After this, I'll go through the photos we took and do the initial culling. This means I'll delete all the photos that are blurry, duplicate, or unbecoming. You don't need to see them, and I don't need to keep them.</p>
		<p>Once this is done, I'll send all the remaining photos for you to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch. These photos will be in black-and-white, small size and watermarked.</p>
		<p>Once you come back to me with your selection, please allow me 1-3 days to finish editing and retouching your photos.</p>
		<p>If you need help printing your photos or creating a photo album, I can assist you with that as well.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

</figure>
<p>I'm not a fan of packages, because they don't fit everyone's needs. Here's what I do, instead.</p>
<p><strong>The photoshoot is free.</strong> You only need to pay for the photos you choose in the Delivery phase. Each photo will be delivered to you with color-grading and retouching, ready for use for sharing or printing. The first 10Ã— photos cost 2.000 HUF each. After 10Ã— photos onwards, the price goes down to 1.000 HUF each, for the rest of the photos. Should you require a lot more photos, let me know, and we'll figure out a personalized pricing for you.</p>
<p>If we shoot at multiple locations, I can drive us between places via e-carsharing. We'll split the costs of this 50-50.</p>
<p>Payment should be made after you're done selecting the photos from the raw ones. I accept bank transfer, Revolut, PayPal or cash. You don't need to deposit an upfront fee for the photoshoot.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Questions You Might Ask</h2>
<p>If you have any more questions, <a href="/en/contact/">don't hesitate to ask</a>, I'll answer promptly!</p>

<div class="faqs"><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I'm not very photogenic, can you help me with posing?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Most of us aren't models who know how they'll look their best in photos. That's exactly how most people in my galleries felt before the photoshoot. Certainly, I'll help you with posing, but that doesn't mean your photos will look posed in the end. I prefer to capture candid moments, for which I'll give you some laid-back, fun, and sometimes silly prompts. These will be the photos with the purest emotions, which you'll love the most!</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How would you describe your photography style?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">My photography style is authentic and candid, with a bit of careful guidance and suggestions for portrait shoots. I'm more of the documenter/photojournalist type than the poser/director type. This means I prefer talking about a concept with you and just letting you be yourself, while I'm busy taking shots from all angles, capturing your most authentic moments. My editing style depends a lot on the time of day and time of year, but I love using warm, golden tones in my images, and I never over-edit my photos.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Where do we walk?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">We can walk and shoot wherever you want in and around Budapest. You may choose any location that is close to your heart. If you don't have a specific idea, I can recommend the inner districts for their photographic possibilities, but I don't shy away from going to a nearby nature reserve or forest to take more close-to-nature photos.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How long is a photo walk?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">We'll stay out for as long as you wish. If you just want a quick walk with a few shots, we're done in 30-45 minutes, but if you want to visit multiple locations and even change outfits along the way, we can stay out for 2-3 hours. If you'd like to shoot all day on a lot of locations, that's all good for me, let's talk about it.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How will I get the finished photos after the shoot?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">You'll receive your photos in a Google Drive or a Dropbox folder as a public link. This means that only those will be able to access the photos who have the link -- that's you and me only. This way, you don't need to give me your email address to view the photos. You'll be able to download the photos in their highest quality and resolution, to even be able to print them yourself.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How long do I need to wait for my edited photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Usually I'll send you the finished photos in 1-3 working days, after you've sent me the ones you selected for editing. Depending on how busy I am with shooting and editing at the given time, this interval might change, but I'll let you know about this in advance.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">What's your backup policy for your photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">My camera has 2 identical memory cards in it, so every time I take a photo, it is written to both memory cards simultaneously. This way, in the unlikely event that one memory card fails, the other card will still have every single photo I took of you. At home, I copy the raw photos from my portrait shoots to two different hard drives, and I keep the backup files until I've sent you your final images.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you edit the final photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Every photo you receive will be individually edited and retouched. All photos you select after the shoot will be color-graded in a way that matches your personality, the location, and the theme of the shoot. Retouching includes removing skin imperfections and unnecessary flying hairs. Your photos won't be over-edited, they'll have just enough artistic touches applied to best tell your story.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Will I get the raw photos, too?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">It's very important for me that you only get 100% done, color-corrected images after your photoshoot. Whether you want to share them with your friends right away or send them to a lab for printing, your photos will be ready-for-use when you receive them. Therefore, I don't send out the unedited raw files.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Why are the photos for selection black-and-white and watermarked?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">The reason for <abbr title='black-and-white'>B/W</abbr> is so that you can better concentrate on the composition, your facial expressions and poses rather than the colors, which will be processed later, anyway. Your photos for selection will be watermarked to denote that they're not final images.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Are the final photos also watermarked?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">No. I believe your final, edited photos speak for themselves and don't need watermarks.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Will my photos show up on your website?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">It is important to me as a photographer to be able to share my latest and greatest work through my website, social media and advertisements. I usually select the best of the best images from my photoshoots, and upload them to my website. Before it happens, if you so prefer, I can send you the photos I've selected, so you can confirm that you like all of them. If you have any questions about this, definitely get in contact with me.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can I share the final photos online?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Of course! You can use your photos for personal use in any way. If you give credit in the description, I'll thank you in a personalized comment. You can upload your photos to your own website, or to any social media platform, but you can print them out in virtually any size. The only thing you can not do is to send your photos to a company who would then use it in their own marketing.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can I print the final photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Sure. You'll receive your photos in the range of 24 Megapixels in size, which is more than enough to print your photos in virtually any size.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can I get some examples on pricing?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer"><ul class='list'><li>You only need 5 photos &mdash; that'll be 10.000 HUF.</li><li>You need 10 photos &mdash; that's 20.000 HUF.</li><li>You need 16 photos &mdash; that's only 26.000 HUF.</li><li>You need 8 photos and we rented a car and used it for a total cost of 3000 HUF &mdash; that's 16.000 + 1.500 = 17.500 HUF.</li></ul></div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How many photos does your average client order?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">My happy clients usually choose around 20 photos. They sometimes only want 5-10 photos initially, but they quickly realize after the shoot that there are plenty more amazing shots they can choose from and usually go around or above 20 photos. The more photos you choose, the more discounts I can give you on your final order.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">What kind of gear do you use?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">I shoot with my trusty Sony Alpha 7 III professional full-frame mirrorless camera with a variety of top quality prime lenses. I use the Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 prime lens for most of my work, including portraits, accompanied by the Sony FE 50mm f/1.8 prime lens for the wider shots. I also use the Sigma 70mm f/2.8 DG Macro Art prime lens for close-up shots and as an in-between focal length between the aforementioned two lenses. I love using my Tamron 20mm f/2.8 Di III OSD for super wide-angle shots. I've also got two, 50-year-old vintage lenses which have their own unique way of rendering images. I've put together a separate page, if you want to <a href='/en/gear/'>learn more about my gear</a>.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">What payment methods do you accept?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">I accept bank transfer (preferred), Revolut, PayPal, or cash. Please make the payment after you've sent me the selected photos for editing, and I've confirmed them with you. Thank you.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How can I book my shooting date?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">You can write me an email here, through my website, or you can send me a Direct message over on Instagram. I don't necessarily prefer communicating through my Facebook Page, as I don't always get a notification there.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How far in advance should I book?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Usually I'm very flexible in terms of free time, so we can, in many cases, shoot on the day you write to me, or the day after. If you have an urgent photoshoot request, definitely contact me, so we can talk about when I can go walk-and-shoot with you. There's no extra charge for urgent photoshoots, if I can manage the shoot.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I'd like to shoot at night, is it possible?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Certainly, we can shoot in the evening hours with the city lights, or at night, even using ancillary light sources like my RGB lightsaber. It's important to mention that the preparation for these shoots usually take longer per location. Also, shots taken at night usually have more grain to them, due to the way camera sensors work. If you have a night project in mind, don't hesitate to reach out to me, I'd love to listen to your idea and talk to you more about the technicalities of what goes into shooting at night.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can we shoot in bad weather as well?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Yes, all my equipment are weather-sealed, and my raincoat, even though I can fit in it twice, can't wait for me to wear it again.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Is it possible to shoot all day in multiple locations?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Absolutely. If you have this type of request, please let me know in advance, so I can plan my day ahead of time. These (4+ hours) photoshoots have an extra full-day commitment fee to them, which is determined on a case-by-case basis. For travelling between locations, I can drive you between places using one of the local e-carsharing services.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I'd like to shoot at a place where we'll need to be silent. Is it possible?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Yes, my camera has a silent mode feature where there's no shutter sound when a photo is taken. If you like to shoot silently, let me know in advance, no problem!</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Is it possible to shoot outside of Budapest, too?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Yes, absolutely. For these cases I use a local e-carsharing service, GreenGo, to get around. GreenGo employs only electric cars with a limited range, so it's best to stay in a 100 km vicinity of Budapest. The daily maximum fee for using this service is 12.000 HUF; which you will need to pay for, on top of the photos selected.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you also shoot events?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Definitely, I've shot public speeches, store openings, and even graduation ceremonies. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have an important event you'd like me to document, and we'll figure out all the details.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you shoot in a studio as well?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Absolutely. Please reach out to me with your specific idea, and we'll figure out the best studio for your photoshoot. Pricing is the same for studio portraits, but please note that paying for the studio rental is your responsibility.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you do headshots?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Certainly. I can help you get professional headshots for LinkedIn, or your company's website or social media. Please note that for headshots, pricing is a little different. Don't hesitate to reach out to me for details, I'll be glad to assist you!</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I've lost the photos you sent me. What do I do now?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">No worries, whatsoever. I've got all your photos on my hard drive and backed up in the cloud, so I can send them to you whenever, no fees attached. Drop me a line, and I'll send them over right away!</div>

				<p class="testimonial__text">They are perfect! All of them! When I was on my way to the photoshoot, I thought to myself, 4 or 5 good photos would be perfectly enough. Well, the 200+ images that Roland took of me during our shoot, were all so great, it was quite a puzzle to narrow them down to my absolute favorites. He would always find the best places and angles, and was expressly open to my ideas all along. He gave me precise but simple instructions, and helped me make the images I dreamt of a reality.</p>
