<ol class="how-it-works">
	<li class="how-it-works__item">
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Preparation</h3>
		<p>Before we get into things, you should have a basic idea for your photoshoot; a theme or a concept. Be sure to send me a few inspirational photos you found online. Here are a few examples to get you started:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Urban photoshoot with modern architectural backgrounds, wearing a smart outfit</li>
			<li>Close-to-nature photoshoot, wearing a long white dress, located in one of the nearby nature reserves or forests in the afternoon</li>
			<li>Night photoshoot downtown with lots of colorful bokeh balls in the background, wearing a shiny, reflective top to play with the city lights</li>
			<li><em>Your creative idea goes here</em> ðŸ˜‰</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Based on your preferences, we'll create a moodboard or a specific shot list together, which we can refer to during your photoshoot.</p>
		<p>Please also have a ballpark number of photos you'd need, as we'll set the length of your photoshoot based on this.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="how-it-works__item">

			<img class="floating-photo__photo" src="/assets/images/photo-walk-02.jpg" alt="Portrait Photo Walks">
			<figcaption class="floating-photo__caption"><em>Photo and edit by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/peterlakinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Lakinger</a></em></figcaption>
		</figure>
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Photoshoot</h3>
		<p>During the photoshoot, I'll gladly assist you with prompts and posing, and tell a bunch of bad jokes to bring out your best smiles.</p>
		<p>I'll also want to listen to your story, if you're willing to tell me. I can also tell you my story, if you're interested.</p>
		<p>We don't need to strictly adhere to our moodboard, so if you find an interesting location that strikes your imagination, say it loud, and we can take a detour. The best photos are the spontaneous ones!</p>
	</li>
	<li class="how-it-works__item">
		<h3 class="how-it-works__title">Delivery</h3>
		<p>I'm a huge advocate of giving clients something on the day of the shoot. For the sake of this, <strong>you'll receive one of my favorite photos of the shoot for free</strong>, edited and retouched, at the end of the day.</p>
		<p>After this, I'll go through the photos we took and do the initial culling. This means I'll delete all the photos that are blurry, duplicate, or unbecoming. You don't need to see them, and I don't need to keep them.</p>
		<p>Once this is done, I'll send all the remaining photos for you to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch. These photos will be in black-and-white, small size and watermarked. Please see the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> for more info.</p>
		<p>Once you come back to me with your selection, please allow me 1-3 days to finish editing and retouching your photos. You'll receive your final images digitally in a Google Drive folder (no email address required).</p>
		<p>If you need help printing your photos or creating a photo album, I can assist you with that as well.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

</figure>
<p>I'm not a fan of packages, because they don't fit everyone's needs. You may not want to spend that much on a given package, or you simply don't need a particular amount of photos a package includes as a minimum. Here's what I do, instead.</p>
<p><strong>The photoshoot is free.</strong> You only need to pay for the photos you choose in the Delivery phase. Each photo with color-grading and retouching costs 1.500 HUF. After 10Ã— photos onwards, the price goes down to 1.000 HUF each. Should you require a lot more photos, let me know, and we'll figure out a personalized pricing for you.</p>
<p>If we shoot at multiple locations, I can drive us between places via e-carsharing. We'll split the costs of this 50-50. There's no need to deposit an upfront fee either for this, or the entire shoot.</p>
<p>Payment should be made after you're done selecting the photos from the raw ones. I accept bank transfer, Revolut, PayPal or cash.</p>

	<div class="faq__answer">
		<ul class="list">
			<li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You only need 5 photos &mdash; that'll be 7.500 HUF.</li>
			<li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You need 10 photos &mdash; that's 15.000 HUF.</li>
			<li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You need 16 photos &mdash; that's only 21.000 HUF.</li>
			<li><strong>Scenario 4:</strong> You need 8 photos and we rented a car and used it for a total cost of 2500 HUF &mdash; that's 12.000 + 1.250 = 13.250 HUF.</li>

<h2 id="faq">Questions You Might Ask</h2>
<p>If you have any more questions, <a href="/en/contact/">don't hesitate to ask</a>, I'll answer promptly!</p>


<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">I'm not very photogenic, can you help me with posing?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">Most of us aren't models who knwo how they'll look their best on photos. That's exactly how most people in my galleries felt before the photoshoot. Certainly, I'll help you with posing, but that doesn't mean your photos will look posed in the end. I much prefet to capture pure emotions, for which I'll give you some laid-back, fun, and sometimes silly prompts. These will be the photos with the purest emotions which you'll love the most!</div>
</details>

<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">How long do I need to wait for my edited photos?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">Usually I'll send you the finished photos in 1-3 working days, after you sent me the ones you've selected for editing. Depending on how busy I am with shooting and editing at the given time, this interval might change, but I'll let you know about this in advance.</div>

</details>


<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">Where do we walk?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">We can walk and shoot wherever you want in Budapest. I prefer the inner districts for photographic possibilities, but I don't shy away from going to a nearby nature reserve or forest to take more close-to-nature photos. I'm available to shoot the entire day as well, however, in this case, a special pricing will be agreed upon.</div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">How long is a photo walk?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">It usually ranges from 30 minutes to 120 minutes or even more. I'm pretty versatile on time, so you can decide if you just want a few headshots taken or stay longer and visit multiple locations and even change outfits.</div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">Do you edit the photos?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">All photos you select after the shoot will be color-graded in a way that matches your personality, the location, and the theme of the shoot. Retouching includes removing skin imperfections and unnecessary flying hairs.</div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">Will I get the raw photos, too?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">I don't hand out unedited photos, only processed ones that reflect my personal editing style. This is to prevent people getting an inaccurate representation of the quality of my work.</div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">Why are the raw photos black-and-white and watermarked?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">The reason for <abbr title="blank-and-white">B/W</abbr> is so that you can better concentrate on the composition, your facial expressions and poses rather than the colors, which will be processed later anyways. Your photos for selection will be watermarked to denote that they're not final images.</div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">Do you shoot in a studio as well?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">Absolutely. Please reach out to me with your specific idea, and we'll figure out the best studio for your photoshoot. Pricing is the same for studio portraits, but please note that paying for the studio rental is your responsibility.</div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
	<summary class="faq__question">Do you do headshots?</summary>
	<div class="faq__answer">Certainly. I can help you get professional headshots for LinkedIn, or your company's website or social media. Please note that for headshots, pricing is a little different. Don't hesitate to reach out to me for details, I'll be glad to assist you!</div>

				<p class="testimonial__text">They are perfect! All of them! When I was on my way to the photoshoot, I thought to myself, 4 or 5 good photos would be perfectly enough. Well, the 200+ images that Roland took of me during our shoot, were all so great, it was quite a puzzle to narrow them down to my absolute favorites. He would always find the best places and angles, and was expressly open to my ideas all along. He gave me precise but simple instructions, and helped me make the images I dreamt of a reality.</p>
