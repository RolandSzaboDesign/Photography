					<div class="faqs"><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How can I book my shooting date?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">You can write me an email here, through my website, or you can send me a Direct message over on Instagram. I don't necessarily prefer communicating through my Facebook Page, as I don't always get a notification there.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How far in advance should I book?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Usually I'm very flexible in terms of free time, so we can, in many cases, shoot on the day you write to me, or the day after. If you have an urgent photoshoot request, definitely contact me, so we can talk about when I can go walk-and-shoot with you. There's no extra charge for urgent photoshoots, if I can manage the shoot.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I'd like to shoot at night, is it possible?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Certainly, we can shoot in the evening hours with the city lights, or at night, even using ancillary light sources like my RGB lightsaber. It's important to mention that the preparation for these shoots usually take longer per location. Also, shots taken at night usually have more grain to them, due to the way camera sensors work. If you have a night project in mind, don't hesitate to reach out to me, I'd love to listen to your idea and talk to you more about the technicalities of what goes into shooting at night.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can we shoot in bad weather as well?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Yes, all my equipment are weather-sealed, and my raincoat, even though I can fit in it twice, can't wait for me to wear it again.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Is it possible to shoot all day in multiple locations?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Absolutely. If you have this type of request, please let me know in advance, so I can plan my day ahead of time. These (3+ hours) photoshoots have an extra full-day commitment fee to them, which is determined on a case-by-case basis. For travelling between locations, I can drive you between places using one of the local e-carsharing services.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I'd like to shoot at a place where we'll need to be silent. Is it possible?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Yes, my camera has a silent mode feature where there's no shutter sound when a photo is taken. I can also walk on tippy-toes like an expert. If you like to shoot silently, let me know in advance!</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Is it possible to shoot outside of Budapest, too?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Yes, absolutely. For these cases I use a local e-carsharing service, GreenGo, to get around. GreenGo employs only electric cars with a limited range, so it's best to stay in a 100 km vicinity of Budapest. The maximum daily fee for using this service is 40 EUR; which you will need to pay for, on top of the base fee.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you also shoot events?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Definitely, I've shot public speeches, store openings, and even graduation ceremonies. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have an important event you'd like me to document, and we'll figure out all the details.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you shoot in a studio as well?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">I'll only do studio sessions with couples or families. Please reach out to me with your specific idea, and we'll figure out the best studio for your photoshoot. Pricing is the same for studio portraits, but please note that renting and paying for the studio is your responsibility.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you do headshots?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Certainly. I can help you get professional headshots for LinkedIn, or your company's website or social media. Don't hesitate to reach out to me for details, I'll be glad to assist you!</div>

					<p>Time for the magic to happen! During our photoshoot, I'm not just your photographer; I'm your guide to making every moment shine.</p>
					<p><strong>Posing Made Easy:</strong> If you're unsure about poses, don't worry—I've got your back. I'll provide friendly and easy-to-follow guidance to help you overcome camera shyness. As we navigate through poses together, any initial uncertainties will give way to your most natural and stunning self.</p>
					<p><strong>Fun and Relaxed Vibes:</strong> Expect a session filled with laughter and genuine moments. My goal is to make you feel at ease, turning any camera shyness into a fun and enjoyable experience. So brace yourself for a bunch of bad jokes and prompts, that bring out your most authentic smiles.</p>
					<p><strong>Connecting Through Stories:</strong> Beyond the camera, I'm all ears for your story. Conversations help us relax, setting the stage for photos without inhibition or hindrances. As we get to know each other, we'll capture wonderful moments that will reflect your true self.</p>
					<p><strong>Your Transformation:</strong> Remember the days of feeling camera shy? Get ready to leave those behind. As we click away, you'll witness the transformation from hesitancy to embracing the camera, and in the end, falling in love with your portraits.</p>

					<div class="faqs"><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I'm not very photogenic, can you help me with posing?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Feeling like you're not naturally photogenic is completely normal, and you're not alone! Many of the individuals featured in my galleries felt the same way before their photoshoot. Rest assured, I'm here to guide you through posing, ensuring you look your best while maintaining a natural and candid feel. While I cherish capturing candid moments with laid-back, fun, and sometimes silly prompts, I also firmly believe in the art of posing. Expertly executed poses not only enhance the visual appeal of your photos but also serve as a powerful tool to ease any camera anxiety you may feel. My goal is to strike a perfect balance, resulting in photos that showcase the purest emotions and leave you absolutely loving the final outcome!</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Where do we walk?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">We can walk and shoot wherever you want in and around Budapest. You may choose any location that is close to your heart. If you don't have a specific idea, I can recommend the inner districts for their photographic possibilities, but I don't shy away from going to a nearby nature reserve or forest to take more close-to-nature photos.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">What's your backup policy for your photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">My camera has 2 identical memory cards in it, so every time I take a photo, it is written to both memory cards simultaneously. This way, in the unlikely event that one memory card fails, the other card will still have every single photo I took of you. At home, I copy the raw photos from my portrait shoots to two different hard drives, and I keep the backup files until I've sent you your final images.</div>

					<p>On the day of the shoot, you'll receive a special treat: one of my favorite photos, edited and retouched, completely free.</p>
					<p>Next, I'll dive into the initial culling phase, removing any blurry, duplicate, or less-than-flattering shots. No need for you to see them, and no need for me to keep them.</p>
					<p>Once the selection is refined, I'll send you the remaining photos. These will be in small size and watermarked. It's your chance to choose the ones you'd like me to edit and retouch.</p>
					<p>Once you've made your selection, sit back for 1-3 days, and I'll work my magic on your chosen photos. And hey, if you need assistance with printing or creating a photo album, I've got you covered!</p>

			<div class="faqs"><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How will I get the finished photos after the shoot?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">You'll receive your photos in a Google Drive or a Dropbox folder as a public link. This means that only those will be able to access the photos who have the link -- that's you and me only. This way, you don't need to give me your email address to view the photos. You'll be able to download the photos in their highest quality and resolution, to even be able to print them yourself.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How long do I need to wait for my edited photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Usually I'll send you the finished photos in 1-5 working days, after you've sent me the ones you selected for editing. Depending on how busy I am with shooting and editing at the given time, this interval might change, but I'll let you know about this well in advance.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Do you edit the final photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Every photo you receive will be individually edited and retouched. All photos you select after the shoot will be color-graded in a way that matches your personality, the location, and the theme of the shoot. Retouching includes removing skin imperfections and unnecessary flying hairs. Your photos won't be over-edited, they'll have just enough artistic touches applied to best tell your story. For retouching I use an artificial intelligence-driven editor, with which I can create shockingly beutiful results for you.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Will I get the raw photos, too?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">It's very important for me that you only get 100% done, color-corrected images after your photoshoot. Whether you want to share them with your friends right away or send them to a lab for printing, your photos will be ready-for-use when you receive them. Therefore, I don't send out the unedited raw files.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Why are the photos in the proof gallery watermarked?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Your photos for selection will be watermarked to denote that they're not final images. Please do not share these raw images, as they're not the final products.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Are the final photos also watermarked?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">No, they are not. I believe your final, edited photos speak for themselves and don't need watermarks.</div>

			<ul class="list">
				<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; Includes 10 edited, retouched photos of your choice after the shoot.</li>
				<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; 1 Free photo on the day of the photoshoot.</li>
				<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; Additional photo selection at 5 EUR each.</li>
				<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle text-highlight"></i>&nbsp; Personalized discounts when choosing lots of photos.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Session Duration:</strong> Usually 1-2 hours, with a maximum of 3 hours. Full-day shoots (over 3 hours) are welcome, and we'll create a personalized pricing structure based on your needs.</p>
			<p><strong>Additional Charges May Apply:</strong></p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><em>Transport:</em> For shoots beyond Budapest's outer districts or countryside, a carsharing fee may apply (max distance in one direction: ~100km, maximum daily fee: 40 EUR).</li>
				<li><em>Multi-location Shoots:</em> If your shoot involves more than one location, carsharing fees may apply (typically a few EUR inside Budapest).</li>
				<li><em>Entry Fees/Permits:</em> Any costs for shooting in locations with entry fees or permits are covered by you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Payment:</strong> Due after selecting your final photos for editing and confirmation of the quantity. Payment options include bank transfer, Revolut, or PayPal. No cash accepted. </p>
			<p><strong>Retainer:</strong> Typically, there's no retainer for regular photoshoots. However, based on the specific shoot and its circumstances, I reserve the right to request a retainer. This would cover carsharing fees or any additional expenditures associated with the unique aspects of the shoot. Rest assured, any such requests will be discussed and agreed upon transparently before the shoot.</p>
			<p><strong>Delivery:</strong> You'll receive your edited and retouched photos, in digital format, in 1-3 days after payment has been made. I don't deliver raw or unedited photos.</p>

That will include an additional 5 photos for further use.</li><li>You need 10 photos &mdash; that's 100 EUR, same as the base fee.</li><li>You choose 20 photos after the shoot &mdash; that's a total of 150 EUR.</li><li>You need 12 photos and we used a carsharing service to travel between locations for 5 EUR &mdash; that's 100 EUR (base fee) + 10 EUR (+2 photos) + 5 EUR (carsharing) = 115 EUR.</li></ul></div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">How many photos does your average client order?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">My happy clients usually choose around 20 photos. Sometimes they only want 10 photos initially, but they quickly realize after the shoot that there are plenty more amazing shots they can choose from and usually go around or above 20 photos. The more photos you choose, the more discounts I can give you on your final order.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Will my photos show up on your website?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">It is important to me as a photographer to be able to share my latest and greatest work through my website, social media and advertisements. I usually select the best of the best images from my photoshoots, and upload them to my website. Before it happens, if you so prefer, I can send you the photos I've selected, so you can confirm that you like all of them. If you have any questions about this, definitely get in contact with me.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can I share the final photos online?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Of course! You can use your photos for personal use in any way. If you give credit in the description, I'll thank you in a personalized comment. You can upload your photos to your own website, or to any social media platform, but you can print them out in virtually any size. The only thing you can not do is to send your photos to a company who would then use it in their own marketing.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">Can I print the final photos?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">Sure. You'll receive your photos in the range of 24 Megapixels in size, which is more than enough to print your photos in virtually any size.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">What kind of gear do you use?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">I shoot with my trusty Sony Alpha 7 III professional full-frame mirrorless camera with a variety of top quality prime and zoom lenses. I've put together a separate page, if you want to <a href='/en/gear/'>learn more about my gear</a>.</div>
		</details><details class="faq">
			<summary class="faq__question">I've lost the photos you sent me. What do I do now?</summary>
			<div class="faq__answer">No worries, whatsoever. I've got all your photos on my hard drive and backed up in the cloud, so I can send them to you whenever, no fees attached. Drop me a line, and I'll send them over right away!</div>
