			<p>In a world consumed by digital photography, film portraits stand out with their genuine, unfiltered beauty. It's a departure from the pixel-perfect, filtered shots that flood our feeds. Instead, film photography captures moments with an authentic depth and character that simply can't be replicated in digital.</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>Authenticity</strong> &ndash; Each frame is carefully crafted, embracing imperfections and real moments that tell your one-of-a-kind story. With its soft tones, rich textures, and subtle grain, film gives your images a timeless allure that you won't find in digital photos.</li>
				<li><strong>Timeless Elegance</strong> &ndash; Film portraits have a classic quality that transcends fleeting trends. Whether you prefer the timeless elegance of black-and-white or the vibrant colors of a sunny day, film preserves the essence of your personality, creating portraits that never go out of style.</li>
				<li><strong>A Mindful Connection</strong> &ndash; With film photography, every shot is deliberate, allowing for a deeper connection between you and your photographer. This mindful approach creates an atmosphere of trust, creativity, and genuine expressions.</li>
				<li><strong>Embrace Surprises</strong> &ndash; Unlike digital photography's instant feedback, film takes you on an exciting journey of anticipation. The anticipation of seeing the final results adds an element of wonder and joy to the process.</li>
				<li><strong>Tangible Memories</strong> &ndash; Holding a print in your hands brings back a sensory experience that scrolling through a screen simply can't match. Film portraits add a touch of magic to your living spaces, reminding you of the moments that truly matter.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You see, film photography isn't just about snapping pictures—it's about embarking on a journey. From selecting the perfect film stocks to calibrating old film cameras with care, every step is infused with anticipation and craftsmanship. It's a slower process, but trust me, the end result is worth it. The joy of waiting, unveiling your photos, and holding prints in your hands—it's an experience like no other.</p>

			<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions, Analog Edition</h2>
			<p>The following questions are specifically applicable to film portraiture photoshoots. If you haven't done so already, please read my <a href="/en/services/portrait-photo-walks/#faq">Portraiture FAQ</a> before continuing here.</p>
			<div class="faqs"><details class="faq" id="pricing">
						<summary class="faq__question">How much does it all cost?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">For a limited time, I'm offering my film photography services at material cost. This mean you only need to pay for the film stock, the development and scanning process, and the oprional printing costs. A more simple, black-and-white film with development and small size scan will cost around 6.000 HUF, but a more exotic color film with development and medium size scan with prints won't go over 20.000 HUF.</div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="choosing-film">
						<summary class="faq__question">Can you provide guidance in choosing the right film stocks?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">Absolutely! We understand that navigating the world of film stocks can be overwhelming, especially with the scarcity of certain options. If your preferred film stock has been discontinued or is temporarily out of stock, we will work closely with you to find an alternative that closely aligns with your vision.</div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="how-long">
						<summary class="faq__question">How long does it take to receive the final images?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">The turnaround time for receiving your final prints depends on the lab we choose for developing the film stock. The lab's processing time may vary, but rest assured that we prioritize quality and timely delivery.</div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="combine-digital">
						<summary class="faq__question">Can I combine film and digital photography for my session?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">Certainly! I understand that both film and digital photography have their unique advantages. If you prefer a blend of the two mediums, I can absolutely accommodate that request. We will discuss your vision and work together to create a seamless fusion of film and digital elements. For the digital images, my regular pricing applies.</div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="gear">
						<summary class="faq__question">What camera and lenses do you use for film portraits?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">I use my trust old soviet-made Zenit E analog SLR camera for film photography with a variety of M42 mount lenses. I offer a wide variety of ~50mm lenses, but I sport a 135mm one with excellent sharpness. My favorite lens is the mightly Helios 44-2 with its swirly bokeh rendering. Definitely write me a message if you want to learn more about the lenses I have.</div>

			<h2>Testimonials</h2>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I met Roland about 2 years ago. I'd tried a lot of photographers before, but since I've known Roli, I travel across the country several times a year, because he's the photographer everyone is looking for. He crafts photos of you that _you_ want, he doesn't interfere with your ideas, but he provides professional advice to make your pictures as great as possible. If you don't have any ideas, no problem; he's helpful in everything, and he's also a good-hearted, funny, and above all fair person, with whom you can easily relax, and thus the photoshoot goes smoothly. I can recommend Roland to everyone even from 200+ km away!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I am camera shy, I don't necessarily like being in front of the camera. Going through our film photoshoot was a bit challenging for me, but Roland made me forget all of my fears during the shoot. He has an easy-going, charming personality, and excellent work ethics; the whole process of shooting film portraits with him felt effortless. He made me feel confident and good about myself throughout the process. Now looking back to the whole experience, I'd say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, kudos to Roland for being such an amazing photographer.</p>
