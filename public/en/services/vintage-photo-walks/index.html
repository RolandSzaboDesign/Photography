			<h2>Why Vintage Lenses?</h2>
			<figure class="floating-photo floating-photo--right">

			<p>Modern (i.e. super-expensive) camera lenses are designed to be so perfect that the imperfections that make a photo realistic are almost completely missing. Having close to perfect image quality does result in extreme ease of use, and the end results are consistently flawless. However, the image quality is so sterile and flat that I'm spending hours in post-production to get my images to look 3D again.</p>
			<p>This is where old vintage optics come in to play. They're full of optical flaws which makes photos taken with them alive and animate. Vintage lenses are more difficult to operate: You need to focus every image one-by-one, they are prone to flaring in direct sunlight, they sometimes leave odd spots in the image, and the list goes on. However, the final photos are something that we can be a lot more proud of, because we're really worked for them. Shooting portraits with vintage lenses is about embracing these optical shortcomings and really enabling our creative juices to flow.</p>

			<h2>How is a portrait photography session different with vintage lenses?</h2>
			<p>Here's a few things to keep in mind, if you're willing to model for a shoot.</p>
			<figure class="floating-photo floating-photo--right">
				<img class="floating-photo__photo aspect-ratio-3-2" src="/assets/images/photo-walk-05.webp" alt="Portrait Photo Walks" width="750" height="500">
				<figcaption class="floating-photo__caption"><em>Photo and edit by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danos_photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danos Nemeth</a></em></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>Every image has to be manually focussed.</strong> My camera has several built-in helping features to assist me in finding the perfect focus, but it still takes time to make sure that the images are as sharp as possible. Because of this, you'll need to hold your mimics and poses for a little longer.</li>
				<li><strong>Images are generally more static.</strong> Because of the manual focusing, we can't accurately capture moving scenes, so manual lenses aren't the go-to option to capture movement in photos.</li>
				<li><strong>We'll need to consider flaring.</strong> Old lenses are highly prone to flaring, when shooting in direct sunlight. While we can use flares creatively, it can make photos unusable very quickly. Because of this, we might need to spend more time finding the best angles according to the sunlight.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All in all, we could say that shooting with vintage lenses requires some more patience and some respect for older technologies, in order to create unique, soulful photos.</p>

			<p>The following questions are specifically applicable to vintage lens portrait shoots. if you haven't done so already, please read my <a href="/en/services/portrait-photo-walks/#faq">Portraiture FAQ</a> before continuing here.</p>
			<div class="faqs"><details class="faq" id="what-are-vintage-lenses">
						<summary class="faq__question">What lenses are considered vintage?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">There's been a whole host of old lenses in used, not just in film cameras, but in x-ray machines as well! Any optic that can project an image, and can be adapted to modern camera bodies, will make it!</div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="gear">
						<summary class="faq__question">What vintage lenses do you own?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">I currently own and frequently use the following lenses: <ul class='list'><li>Carl Zeiss Jena Sonnar 135mm f/3.5</li><li>Carl Zeiss Jena Tessar 50mm f/2.8</li><li>Helios 44-2 58mm f/2.0</li><li>Helios 44M-4 58mm f/2.0</li><li>Super-Takumar 50mm f/1.4 (7 element)</li></ul></div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="backup-lens">
						<summary class="faq__question">Are you bringing a modern autofocus lens as well?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">Yes, but only as a backup. In case the lens breaks, catches fire, or gets lost or swallowed by the Earth, then I'll have a proper AF lens with me, just in case.</div>
					</details><details class="faq" id="additional-costs">
						<summary class="faq__question">Are there any additional costs with a vintage lens shoot?</summary>
						<div class="faq__answer">No. The same prices apply to vintage portrait shoots than to regular portrait shoots.</div>

		<p class="testimonial__text">I have always been the anxious type, and this was no different before the photo shoot with Roland. I had never been on a shoot before, I didn't know what the joint work would be like, how I should pose for the pictures, or how much I would be able to let myself go. But this excitement passed after the first few minutes. It was great to talk for a few minutes before we got into the shoot, so I could settle in for the occasion better. I felt very comfortable with Roland's encouragement along the way, and his jokes were also good, which helped me a lot to be able to smile honestly! I've never had so many good pictures taken of me before, and I couldn't wait to get them. All in all, I very much enjoyed the photo shoot, it was a perfect first-time experience, and I hope I will have the opportunity to do more like this!</p>

		<p class="testimonial__text">Before the photo shoot, I was a little afraid of whether the photos would turn out well, since I don't have much experience in modeling and so far only friends and acquaintances have taken photos of me. I moved out of my comfort zone on this occasion, but at the same time the style itself (vintage, retro) was very close to me, so I still felt comfortable taking photos. This was perhaps the first time I had the earliest time to dissolve during a photo shoot. I was glad that Roli was interested in my opinion, he showed me the photos, he was interested in whether I had any ideas about the location or posing. I liked that we worked together to create these wonderful images, and I didn't feel like I had to cope with the task alone. Overall, I can say that Roli does a very high-quality and creative job during the photography and post-production!</p>
