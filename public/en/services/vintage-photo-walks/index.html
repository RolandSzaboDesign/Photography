		<p class="page-header__intro">Let's make your portraits really special with vintage lenses made for old film cameras! Extraordinary colors, fabled background bokeh and stylistic image quality.</p>
	</header>

	<h2>Why Vintage Lenses?</h2>
	<figure class="floating-photo floating-photo--right">
		<img class="floating-photo__photo aspect-ratio-3-2" src="/assets/images/photo-walk-04.webp" alt="Portézós Fotós Séták" width="750" height="500">

	</figure>
	<p>Modern (i.e. super-expensive) camera lenses are designed to be so perfect that the imperfections that make a photo realistic are almost completely missing. Having close to perfect image quality does result in extreme ease of use, and the end results are consistently flawless. However, the image quality is so sterile and flat that I'm spending hours in post-production to get my images to look 3D again.</p>
	<p>This is where old vintage optics come in to play. They're full of optical flaws which makes photos taken with them alive and animate. Vintage lenses are more difficult to operate: You need to focus every image one-by-one, they are prone to flaring in direct sunlight, they sometimes leave odd spots in the image, and the list goes on. However, the final photos are something that we can be a lot more proud of, because we're really worked for them. Shooting portraits with vintage lenses is about embracing these optical shortcomings and really enabling our creative juices to flow.</p>
	<h2>How is a portrait photography session different with vintage lenses?</h2>
	<p>Here's a few things to keep in mind, if you're willing to model for a shoot.</p>
	<figure class="floating-photo floating-photo--left">
		<img class="floating-photo__photo aspect-ratio-3-2" src="/assets/images/photo-walk-05.webp" alt="Portézós Fotós Séták" width="750" height="500">
		<figcaption class="floating-photo__caption"><em>Photo and edit by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danos_photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danos Nemeth</a></em></figcaption>
	</figure>
	<ul class="list">
		<li><strong>Every image has to be manually focussed.</strong> My camera has several built-in helping features to assist me in finding the perfect focus, but it still takes time to make sure that the images are as sharp as possible. Because of this, you'll need to hold your mimics and poses for a little longer.</li>
		<li><strong>Images are generally more static.</strong> Because of the manual focusing, we can't accurately capture moving scenes, so manual lenses aren't the go-to option to capture movement in photos.</li>
		<li><strong>We'll need to consider flaring.</strong> Old lenses are highly prone to flaring, when shooting in direct sunlight. While we can use flares creatively, it can make photos unusable very quickly. Because of this, we might need to spend more time finding the best angles according to the sunlight.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All in all, we could say that shooting with vintage lenses requires some more patience and some respect for older technologies, in order to create unique, soulful photos.</p>

	<h2>Sample Images</h2>
	<p>Here is a selection of some of my favorite vintage portrait photos. If you like the rendering of one of these optics, do let me know when enquiring for a shoot! If you'd like to watch a full set of vintage lens portraits, then definitely check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/portraiture/jazmin/">our Wonderland set with Jázmin</a> and our maiden shoot of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/portraiture/eperke/">Zeiss Sonnar 135mm with Eperke</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions, Vintage Edition</h2>
	<p>The following questions are specifically applicable to vintage lens portrait shoots. if you haven't done so already, please read my <a href="/en/services/portrait-photo-walks/#faq">Portraiture FAQ</a> before continuing here.</p>

	<div class="faqs"><details class="faq" id="what-are-vintage-lenses">
				<summary class="faq__question">What lenses are considered vintage?</summary>
				<div class="faq__answer">There's been a whole host of old lenses in used, not just in film cameras, but in x-ray machines as well! Any optic that can project an image, and can be adapted to modern camera bodies, will make it!</div>
			</details><details class="faq" id="gear">
				<summary class="faq__question">What vintage lenses do you own?</summary>
				<div class="faq__answer">I currently own and frequently use the following lenses: <ul class='list'><li>Carl Zeiss Jena Sonnar 135mm f/3.5</li><li>Carl Zeiss Jena Tessar 50mm f/2.8</li><li>Helios 44-2 58mm f/2.0</li><li>Helios 44M-4 58mm f/2.0</li><li>Super-Takumar 50mm f/1.4 (7 element)</li></ul></div>
			</details><details class="faq" id="backup-lens">
				<summary class="faq__question">Are you bringing a modern autofocus lens as well?</summary>
				<div class="faq__answer">Yes, but only as a backup. In case the lens breaks, catches fire, or gets lost or swallowed by the Earth, then I'll have a proper AF lens with me, just in case.</div>
			</details><details class="faq" id="additional-costs">
				<summary class="faq__question">Are there any additional costs with a vintage lens shoot?</summary>
				<div class="faq__answer">No. The same prices apply to vintage portrait shoots than to regular portrait shoots.</div>
			</details></div>

					<p class="testimonial__text">They are perfect! All of them! When I was on my way to the photoshoot, I thought to myself, 4 or 5 good photos would be perfectly enough. Well, the 200+ images that Roland took of me during our shoot, were all so great, it was quite a puzzle to narrow them down to my absolute favorites. He would always find the best places and angles, and was expressly open to my ideas all along. He gave me precise but simple instructions, and helped me make the images I dreamt of a reality.</p>

					<p class="testimonial__text">The photoshoot with Roland went in a very informal manner right from the start. This was my first shoot, so it helped me tremendously to relax. He put in his best effort to create a diverse range of photos that I was very happy with. He helped me figure out my posing, and was always open to my ideas... and the end results turned out stunning!</p>

					<p class="testimonial__text">Do you know that feeling when noone can take proper photos of you? I went with this exact feeling to Roland, who, thanks to his great vision, creativity and endless patience, proved me wrong; and then there was me trying to select from a great number of amazing pictures he'd delivered. As a bonus to the beautiful photos, you also get an endlessly cool and funny photographer.</p>
