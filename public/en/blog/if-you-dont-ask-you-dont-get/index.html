<p>My recent work for GreenGo has been featured on <a href="https://index.hu/gazdasag/2024/03/05/greengo-carsharing-automegoszto-fenntarthato-kozlekedes-elektromos-auto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">index.hu</a>, but I'm not writing this to brag all about it. Instead, I want to tell you about my ever-present mantra for photography and how it can help you as well.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of my photography career, I've encountered many situations where I really desired something: an opportunity to showcase my work, a chance to collaborate with another photographer or a business, or a photoshoot with a model. By just the simple act of asking, I eventually got many opportunities that were instrumental in my career progress.</p>

<h2>My Story with GreenGo and How I Got my First Gig</h2>

<p>I started using e-carsharing in Budapest about 3 years ago. As an environmentally conscious person, I chose GreenGo because their all-electric fleet. I liked the service so much that one day I emailed them about a possible photography collaboration. I'd taken one of their cars to a location and taken some photos with it, just to have something to show them as a reference. They replied a few days later saying that if they needed any photography services, they'd let me know. Standard response for <em>no, thank you</em>.</p>

<p>After the rejection, I continued to use the service for my day-to-day stuff. In preparation for my upcoming car shoots, I'd use GreenGo cars to scout locations and to take test shots. Some of these shots were made so good that I posted them to GreenGo's Facebook Group, for fellow drivers to see and enjoy. They actually got quite a lot of attention.</p>

<p>Two years after I sent them my email, I got a phone call in the morning from their marketing manager. I thought, oh shit, what did I do wrong, am I going to be fined? But all he really wanted to say was that they really liked the last couple of photos in the FB group and asked me if I still wanted to shoot for them. I had waited two years for this phone call and I just couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>They lined up a special photoshoot for me, where I had to shoot 13 cars in one photo as the conclusionof their Good Causes 2023 campaign, and I was the one chosen to do it. They loved the photos so much that 2 months later, I was one of the first people to see their new car in person and photograph it for the launch campaign. These are the photos that appeared in yesterday's article on Index.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Don't go empty-handed</strong> &ndash; I included a link to some of the photos I'd taken in my email, so that I already had something to show them. Create at least a small body of work before you ask, so that they can get a feel for the quality of your work.</li>
	<li><strong>Rejection doesn't mean no</strong> &ndash; If they say no, it doesn't mean no forever. They may already have a photographer they're working with at the moment, but what happens if that changes? Who will they come to? Obviously the ones who reached out to them earlier.</li>
	<li><strong>Consistency is key</strong> &ndash; As clichéd as it sounds, consistency really is key. Had they forgotten my name since my first email, I wouldn't have let them. By posting a well-made photo to their Facebook group every now and then, I made sure my name was kept in the loop.</li>
	<li><strong>Give your absolute best</strong> &ndash; Once you've got the gig, give it your all and then some. Act professional. Be proactive. Ask questions before they are asked. Underpromise and overdeliver. Be the photographer they want to work with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In Closing</h2>
<p>This is my story on the importance of asking. I encourage you to take the leap, and make the ask. Sooner or two years later, the opportunities <em>will</em> unfold before you. If you don't ask&hellip;</p>
