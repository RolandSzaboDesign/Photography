					<h2 class="section__title">About</h2>
					<p>My name is Roland, and I'm an amateur photographer based in Budapest. I love cars and photography, so I like to combine the two and do car photography for fun.</p>
					<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've been in love with cars, and in the recent years I took lots of carspotting photos with my phone. Shortly after buying my first digital camera, I met a friend who would let me photograph his very exclusive car in a controlled environment. That was the moment when I started seriously studying and practicing car photography.</p>
					<p>I shoot with a Sony a6000 with the 28-70 mm kit lens. It's fairly basic gear, but they're trusty companions to work with. I also have a few bits of equipment to ensure good image quality.</p>
					<p>When not shooting, I design and develop websites and user experiences.</p>
